            <h2>America’s Elections are No Longer Democratic</h2>
            <div class="blurb">
                America was founded ‘for the people, by the people’ but American elections no longer represent ‘the people’ and are certainly not ruled ‘by the people.’ This is how to fix America’s broken electoral system. 
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                <p dir="ltr">This election season has, so far, been one of turmoil and one that has scared party elites. Commentators have speculated that 2016 will be the year that the people will regain control of the electoral system - back from the low point in 2000. But how can the populous regain control of the American presidential election when they were never intended to have it.</p>
                <p dir="ltr">This article will examine the reasons behind America&rsquo;s electoral problems and do something that is not very popular in the Land of the Free - oppose the Constitution.</p>
                <p dir="ltr">When the constitution was written, it was left to the states to decide how they would choose their Electoral College electors - although they all currently select the electors by popular vote, this was not always the case, many states historically had their state legislatures select their electors.</p>
                <p dir="ltr">With all of the 50 states and the District of Columbia, selecting their Electoral College electors by popular votes and over half punishing electors who do not vote for their pledged candidate - why do we continue the Electoral College?</p>
                <p dir="ltr">The short answer: tradition.</p>
                <p dir="ltr">During the Constitutional Convention in 1787, the majority of states agreed with Congress electing the president but the Committee of Eleven - who organised and sorted out the details of the Constitution - advised that, instead, the President be elected by an organisation resembling today&rsquo;s Electoral College - this was to make sure of the President&rsquo;s independence from Congress. &nbsp;</p>
                <p dir="ltr">A few delegates, including the venerable James Madison, favored the election of the President by popular vote - our preferred method - but one small obstacle stood in their way: slavery. Due to the problems with the coexistence of &nbsp;suffrage and slavery, this approach was abandoned in favour of the current system.</p>
                <p dir="ltr">But is now obvious - the Electoral College was not the correct choice. There are many problems with the College, including its winner take all nature and faithless electors. In all but two states, the winner of the state wins all that state&rsquo;s electors - even if the victor only wins by a tiny margin - this has caused situations where the popular winner has lost in the Electoral College votes, this last happened in 2000 when Al Gore won the popular vote by nearly a &frac12; million people but lost the final election. The faithless electors are also a problem - when someone chooses a candidate on the ballot and that candidate wins, they expect the people voting for them to vote for their candidate and not for another person they prefer.</p>
                <p dir="ltr">There is no slavery to stand in the way of a proper national popular vote for President and the Electoral College isn&rsquo;t working right - so why don&rsquo;t we change it?</p>
                <p>Making the President a popularly elected official would take a constitutional amendment of the scale unseen since the Bill of Rights and with a fully Republican congress and just under half of states being controlled by Republican governments, that is unlikely to happen anytime soon.</p>
                <p>So that is what our dream of a popularly elected president remains: a dream.</p>
