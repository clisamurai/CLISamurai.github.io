                <h1>Our Proposal<small> to reform New Zealand's property taxation</small></h1>
            </div>
            <article>
                <p>
                    We propose the funding of councils by a land value tax, also called a location value tax, site valuation tax or <b>the perfect tax</b>. 
                    Land value taxes (LVTs) are levied as a fraction, usually very small, of the <a href="http://www.localcouncils.govt.nz/lgip.nsf/wpg_url/Resources-Glossary-Index#Landvalue">unimproved value of land</a> - i.e. the value of the property minus the market value of any improvements like buildings. 
                    They improve economic efficiency, reduce inequality and wil reduce property prices by penalising land-banking and encouraging development.
                    They are also fair: the value of unimproved land is attributable to its location and the society around it, not the work of its owners.
                    LVTs have been successfully implemented throughout the world, including in parts of Australia and the United States as well as Denmark, Hong Kong and Lithuania.
                    Put simply, they are the most intelligent way to tax property.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are indifferent (although our members may not be) about whether the move to an LVT should be nationally-mandated or on a per-council basis, with central government encouragement. 
                    Some members of the Campaign support the expansion of LVTs so as to fund (partially or otherwise) central government, however the immediate position of the Campaign relates only to
                    local government funding.
                </p>
