                            As so happens with Milton Friedman quotes, this one enscapulates my thoughts exactly: The fundamental problem with government
                            intervention in both the market and private affairs is that no government official, no matter
                            how intelligent, can understand each individual better than the individual himself. This problem
                            is multiplied at government scale, where civil servants and parliamentarians make decisions effecting
                            millions of people and families.
                        </p>
                        <p>F. A. Hayek, another of my favourite economists and political philosophers, is one of the foremost
                            experts on this issue. His essay,
                            <a href="https://fee.org/articles/the-use-of-knowledge-in-society">the Use of Knowledge in Society</a>, in his verbose German style, discusses in more detail the
                            issues with centralized planning and the comparative efficacy of market processes. It comes highly
                            recommended from me - indeed, I believe it ought to be made required reading for all civil servants
                            and Members of Parliament.</p>

                    <div class="card-body">
                        <p>I wrote the following letter, in my personal capacity, to the editor of
                            <i>The Australian</i>, a conservative broadsheet paper, regarding the
                            <i>Citizenship Seven</i> scandal and the
                            <a href="http://eresources.hcourt.gov.au/showCase/2017/HCA/45">judgment of the High Court of Australia thereon.</a>

                            <p>Sir,</p>
                            <p>I write in reference to the recent judgment of the High Court of Australia disqualifying the
                                former Deputy Prime Minister and others from their posts in Parliament, in particular, the
                                meaning of the term of &ldquo;foreign power&rdquo; in Section 44 of the Constitution.</p>
                            <p>The Court, under the precedent set by Sue v Hill, took this term to have its widest possible
                                meaning: any power not the Commonwealth of Australia. In my view, this is a poor understanding
                                of the term, that lacks an understanding of the distinction between Commonwealth realms and
                                foreign states.</p>
                            <p>There is a reason that Commonwealth realms (for instance, New Zealand, Australia and the United
                                Kingdom) do not have ambassadors but rather High Commissioners to the other realms. This
                                is the same reason that the United Kingdom does not have a Foreign Office but rather a Foreign
                                and Commonwealth Office and that a Commonwealth citizen, but not an EU citizen, can be a
                                member of the British Parliament. There is a distinction between a fellow Commonwealth realm
                                and a wholly foreign power.
                                <br />Sir,</p>

                            <p>There is a reason that Commonwealth realms (for instance, New Zealand, Australia and the United
                                Kingdom) do not have ambassadors but rather High Commissioners to the other realms. This
                                is the same reason that the United Kingdom does not have a Foreign Office but rather a Foreign
                                and Commonwealth Office and that a Commonwealth citizen, but not an EU citizen, can be a

                                and a wholly foreign power.</p>
                            <p>Each realm shares a common monarch, who is the personification of the state. When two nations,
                                even constitutional monarchies with differing political and legal systems, share a monarch,
                                they are considered to be in a personal union and, not wholly independent from one another.
                                Surely two states, personified by a single, shared inpidual, cannot be considered to be foreign
                                to one another.</p>
                            <p>Thus, the High Court&rsquo;s decision to disqualify the New Zealand and British citizens, including
                                the former Deputy Prime Minister, of the Citizenship Seven under Section 44 of the Australian
                                Constitution and the precedent set by Sue v Hill seems, with a wider understanding of the
                                constitutional situation in the Commonwealth realms, counterintuitive and open to much debate.</p>
                            <p>Yours &amp;c,</p>
                            <br>

                            <p>Sir,</p>
                            <p>I was disturbed on Friday to see your publication stoop to new lows by publishing a counterfactual
                                article by Peter Malcolm which was comprised entirely of groundless assertions on the basis
                                of mere anecdotes in complete disregard for findings of esteemed economists and other experts
                                in the matter of economic inequality.</p>
                            <p>A good example of the many logical fallacies and simple fabrications in the article is the assertion
                                in the title that inequality in New Zealand is“worsening.” In fact, the Gini coefficient
                                for income (the standard metric for income inequality used by economists) both before and
                                after taxes and transfers has remained relatively stable since the 1990s – with some minor
                                volatility recently as a result of the Global Financial Crisis. There are many other examples
                                littered throughout the article, however the limits of this format make it impossible for
                                me to list and disprove them all.</p>
                            <p>I am frankly astonished that an article guilty of such crimes against logic and fact has been
                                published in your newspaper and I hope a retraction is forthcoming.</p>
