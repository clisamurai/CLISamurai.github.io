                            At Auckland Grammar School, New Zealand's

                            I currently study Advanced Level Maths, Physics, Economics and History, having completed Advanced Subsidiary Level English in 2018. 
                            In addition, I am studying toward NZQA Scholarship in, inter alia, English, Maths, Economics, Geography, and History. I am currently in 7A (the top-ranked Year 13 class) and a School and Tibbs Hosue Prefect.

                        <p class="blurb">In 2018, I was named a University Entrance Scholar with a place on the School’s Honours Board, after having won New Zealand Scholarships (awarded to the top 3% of candidates in the country) in Economics, Health & Physical Education, and English, as well as an Outstanding Scholarship in History. 
                            In 2017, I was the first Grammar student ever to have achieved an

                        In 2019, I was the first-ever Auckland Grammar student to win a Gold Award in the New Zealand Economics Olympiad. I was selected to represent New Zealand at the International Economics Olympiad in St Petersburg, Russia. Unfortunately, due to a clash with the World Schools' Debating Championship, I could not attend. In 2019, I was also Governor of the Auckland Grammar School team who were runners-up in the Reserve Bank's Monetary Policy Challenge, where teams have to simulate the creation of a Monetary Policy Statement and the setting of the OCR. In 2018, I was National Champion of the New Zealand Economics Competition, in the Year 12 division.

Relatedly, in 2018, I won the Martin Sullivan Prize for Public Speaking, awarded to the best public speaker at Auckland Grammar, based on an academic and persuasive speech on a high-brow topic.
