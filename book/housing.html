                            illustrates why the housing crisis in Auckland and around the country is so
                            damaging to our nation and its citizens. Without a stable home, it is
                            impossible to hold down a job, for children to take advantage of their
                            schooling, and to enjoy the basics of human dignity.

                            It is probably entirely unnecessary to outline to a contemporary New
                            Zealand audience the problem in housing: Every single issue of the <em>New Zealand
                                Herald</em> contains at least one column lamenting it –
                            that alone is evidence of the problem. But the graph below could be of use
                            in illustrating the scale of the problem.

                        <p>
                            Clearly, house prices have significantly diverged from incomes. This crisis
                            means many New Zealanders, including those with university educations, a
                            traditionally privileged group, are unable to access those aforementioned
                            benefits of housing.

                        <p>
                            The dramatic expansion in housing costs has increased inequality in New
                            Zealand. According to research from the New Zealand Initiative, based on
                            data from the Ministry of Social Development, while nominal income
                            inequality has been relatively stable since the 1980s, after housing costs,
                            inequality has significantly expanded (Wilkinson &amp; Jarem, 2016). This
                            fuels a dog-eats-dog view of the economic system, which encourages
                            detrimental and dangerous populist policy-making – like the Sixth Labour
                            Government’s foreign buyer ban.

                            Obviously, we must address the divergence between incomes and house prices.
                            Raising incomes must surely be part of the solution in the long run, but
                            the rapidly rising price of housing is clearly the main accelerant of this
                            crisis. So, what is behind those high prices?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Many blame wealthy foreigners – people like Peter Thiel and Kim Doctom –
                            and New Zealand’s rapidly growing immigrant population. They are clearly
                            wrong to blame non-resident speculators: In late 2017, non-residents made
                            up only 3% of house purchases (Land Information New Zealand, 2018). They
                            may, however, be correct that immigration pushes up housing prices.
                            However, these higher prices and therefore profit margins for builders and
                            developers should simply encourage more houses to be built to make up for
                            this increased demand: We don’t, however, see this in sufficient quantities
                            – this suggests the problem actually lies on the supply-side.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Others say that easy money, fuelled by record-low central bank interest
                            rates, is behind the price rises. This might too be partially behind the
                            price rises, but it does not explain why New Zealand price rises have been
                            significantly more than those elsewhere, given money has been loose
                            (indeed, looser) globally. Again, this suggests the problem is on the
                            supply-side: We aren’t building enough houses to match increased demand.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The problem is a lack of price responsiveness. As rising demand (from both
                            internal and external immigration, particularly) increases the price of
                            houses in Auckland, houses aren’t being built to satisfy this new demand,
                            resulting in a significant and permanent increase in prices.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On one hand, a slovenly response rate is unsurprising. Houses and the
                            required infrastructure are slow to build, especially in a city like
                            Auckland where the geography and volcanic rock underground make tunnelling
                            and complex road development tricky.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The problem with this interpretation is that our building rate is
                            significantly slower than in past times. Whereas in 1974, 38,000 houses
                            were consented to be built, only 30,000 were in 2016. I do concede that we
                            have been gradually been exhausting our easiest-to-build-on land and that
                            building a new home now may involve doing so in a more inconvenient and
                            difficult location. Still, it seems implausible that with the improvement
                            in technology and significantly larger population we have now, we cannot
                            match the same building rate: Environmental and technological factors are
                            not to blame.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This suggests an exogenous factor must be affecting house prices. There
                            must be some sort of interference. To those familiar with the New Zealand
                            construction market, the answer is obvious: The Resource Management Act
                            (RMA).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Under the RMA, local authorities throughout New Zealand, under the guise of
                            protecting the environment, centrally plan where houses may be built. Given
                            the failure of central planning in many other New Zealand industries
                            (including most of the ones Sir Roger Douglas and his Cabinet colleagues
                            privatized and deregulated during the 1980s), is it any surprise that the
                            most failing industry in New Zealand is one of the most regulated?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My assertion that government land use regulation is responsible for New
                            Zealand’s housing woes is backed up by the empirical evidence. According to
                            the Social Policy Evaluation and Research Unit, a now-defunct government
                            think tank, land use regulation is responsible for 56% of the value of the
                            average Auckland house (Lees, 2017). A research note from the Productivity
                            Commission found that the effect of the Auckland Metropolitan Urban Limit,
                            in particular, was significant – but particularly (and detrimentally for
                            inequality concerns), for land priced in the lower quartile or near the
                            median (Zheng, 2013): Lower-quartile land within 2 kilometres of the limit
                            was, on average, 8 times more expensive than that 2 kilometres or less
                            outside the limit.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But this illiberal policy is not only having damaging social effects; it is
                            sure to have quite serious economic consequences. Restrictive land use
                            rules put councils, rather than the market, in charge of how we allocate
                            one of our most valuable and scarce resources: Land. Councils are clearly
                            not the ideal people to decide how we allocate land. Owners, who are
                            familiar with the industry and have, typically, been using the land for
                            many years know far better than council plans set five years ago whether a
                            given section of land would be better used for farmland or housing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Illiberal planning rules also restricts migration within New Zealand. Many
                            yearn for a return to days past, to New Zealand as a nation of small towns.
                            In reality, however, as cities are better for our economy and environment <a href="#_ftn1"
                                name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. They create economies of
                            scale, whereby larger firms can be sustained and achieve significant cost
                            savings by virtue of their size (see Ikea finally announcing it will come
                            to Auckland). They also allow economies in distribution – it is cheaper and
                            more environmentally friendly to deliver one large consignment of a given
                            good, like iPhones, to a city than small consignments to settlements spread
                            across the country. Proximity, too, allows ‘knowledge spillovers’ and for
                            industries to develop: Lots of firms in the same industry together
                            increases the supply of skilled workers. Cities also, presuming they have
                            some semblance of a public transit system, reduce the reliance on polluting
                            private car transport. They also limit the destruction of habitats by
                            containing populations within more limited areas and reduce the need for
                            expensive long-distance infrastructure-building in remote areas. Strict
                            planning laws make it more expensive for individuals to move into the city,
                            even if would make them and the environment better off. In the United
                            States, recent rigorous modelling of land use restrictions found the
                            ‘spatial misallocation’ of labour they caused reduced national GDP by 36%
                            between 1964 and 2009 (Hsieh &amp; Moretti, 2018). Given the stringency of
                            New Zealand’s planning restrictions compared to most localities in the
                            United States (of well-known cities, only San Francisco has <em>prima facie </em>more
                            restrictive planning controls than Auckland), we
                            could expect similarly severe results.

                            Therefore, I propose a significant liberalisation of New Zealand’s urban
                            development laws.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We should first repeal the Resource Management Act, which is the principal
                            legislative instrument for land use regulation. This should be separated
                            into a Common Resources Act, which will protect natural resources like
                            fresh water and wildlife (discussed in the Environment section), and a
                            Development Act, to manage land use regulation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This Development Act should be out of the hands of councils. They are
                            incentivized to keep house prices high. This is because their revenue is
                            based on land values (through rates). In addition, voting turnout for local
                            bodies is very low amongst non-homeowners, meaning the homeowner lobby is
                            disproportionately powerful at local government level. Instead, it should
                            be administered in Wellington. This won’t be a difficult task because the
                            bill I propose is very simple.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This Act should repeal the existing local government zoning plans and
                            permit property owners to build whatever they wish to as high as safely
                            possible anywhere and remove the rural-urban boundary. It should return
                            control of noise and such to the common law of nuisance, allowing a
                            common-sense approach to be taken by courts, in the context of the
                            complaint.

                            approach to land use would inevitably lead to the spread of cities and, for
                            instance, Auckland enveloping Hamilton. They complain about the
                            environmental damage caused by and infrastructural costs of excessive
                            travel distances. I think this is wrong on multiple counts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For one, building upwards in the central cities is – in the absence of
                            excessive regulation – often cheaper and, certainly, more attractive to
                            young professionals, because it is nearer to their social and commercial
                            centres. This suggests that an increase in height could be a more likely
                            outcome than a move out.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In any case, with a more user-pays model of infrastructure pricing (which I
                            strongly support and will outline in the Infrastructure section), we could
                            disincentivize building too far out of town and have those who do pay the
                            public costs thereof. The environmental concerns are overblown anyhow: Fuel
                            companies are required, under the Emissions Trading Scheme, to take account
                            of the carbon emissions from downstream fuel usage and I support a more
                            comprehensive and intelligent communal resource management system to
                            replace the RMA (as I shall detail in the Environment section).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            More broadly, a significant problem with a liberalized planning system is
                            its interaction with other public services. Critics contest that allowing
                            people to build wherever they wish makes planning government investment,
                            for instance in schools, hospitals, and roads, very difficult. This has
                            argument has some merit.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In reply, it is useful to note that the same complaint could not
                            significantly be made of supermarkets and other privately-provided
                            services. This is because the increased (and anticipated) demand for these
                            services will encourage firms to move in to seize more profits – the price
                            mechanism in action. In addition, developers often seek to ensure such
                            infrastructure is already present, to increase the value of the homes they
                            are building. This is particularly true in a post-liberalization world,
                            where building to match such unfilled demand is far faster, easier, and
                            cheaper. Many of the policy proposals of this book centre on getting the
                            price mechanism to operate in the public services. If such reforms are also
                            conducted, we can rely on the same processes to address most of these
                            problems.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another complaint some might make is that it will lead to ugly, unplanned,
                            blighted communities. The simple counter-argument is to point to the many
                            beautiful communities which have been built without town planning. Remuera
                            and the old homes of Mt Eden, for instance, were all built before the time
                            of town planning. Most of the picturesque villages of small-town England
                            predate their Town and Country Planning Act by centuries. It is not in the
                            interest of landowners to make purposefully ugly or purposefully
                            inconsistent homes – their resale values would not be as high. Secondly, if
                            a group of neighbours, or one neighbour, found a property particularly
                            objectionable, they could well organise together and pay the landowner to
                            change the design<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>.
                            Thirdly, the common law is well-suited to these sorts of problems.
                            Developers can, and do, place restrictive covenants on the title of land
                            they sell, ensuring higher property values for all householders by
                            maintaining a consistent architectural style on the land. A similar
                            rationale can be applied when one property owner has valuable views he
                            wishes to preserve. In a system of clear property rights, like the one
                            outlined in the Development Act, he could pay the landowner below him to
                            place a covenant on his land to prevent it being built up – this
                            transaction would only take place if the value of the views exceeded that
                            of the possible expansion of the other house.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The biggest complaint, however, surrounds the trade-off between the
                            property rights of homeowners and their neighbours. Building on one’s own
                            land is clearly within the rights of a property owner. However, where does
                            one’s right to build stop and one’s neighbour’s right to sunlight begin?
                            The old Oliver Wendell Jones, Jr. maxim of “your right to swing your arms
                            ends where my face begins” doesn’t seem to apply in any clear-cut way here.
                            Thus, it is a question of legitimately contestable public policy, and ends
                            up becoming a test of a jurisdiction’s relative concern for incumbent
                            homeowners (who benefit from the maintenance of status-quo height buildings
                            and prices) and those seeking housing (who want more built, including
                            upwards in central suburbs, no matter the effect on sunlight). To me, the
                            answer of whom we should prefer seems obvious. Surely, we should seek for
                            public policy – when the ‘right’ solution is ambiguous – to be in the
                            long-term interests of the poorest. How are they served by the maintenance
                            of the views in Remuera households? It is unclear, but the benefit to them
                            of a dramatic expansion in housing supply is clear and immediate: longer
                            house prices and a better standard of living.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The argument some – including ideological allies of mine – might make is
                            that such an <em>ex post facto</em> change of the property right in favour
                            of development and away from conservation amounts to an expropriation of
                            existing householders. They could argue that such an ‘expropriation’, in
                            addition to being morally wrong, would undermine confidence in the system
                            of property rights in New Zealand and deter foreign investment here.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the first place, I would contest the extent to which this change could
                            be considered an expropriation for moral purposes. This is a removal of an
                            arbitrary property right, granted by government and with no basis in
                            so-called natural law. Indeed, its replacement – a presumption in favour of
                            development – is probably more compatible with ‘natural law’. After all,
                            the original principle of the English common law was <em> Cuius est solum, eius est usque ad
                                coelum et ad inferos</em>:
                            Landowners were the owners of everything above their plot to the heavens
                            and below to hell and therefore, could build whatever they pleased. On a
                            moral basis, if one considers ‘natural’ law to be the arbiter thereof, this
                            policy could then be a correction.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the second case, I am sure that, so long as proper process was followed
                            in making the change, foreign investors would not be scared off. Indeed,
                            this is an ex-post change to a property right. But, crucially, it is only a
                            change to arbitrary rights created in land. Investors are clearly able to
                            distinguish between such property rights and those they hold, for instance,
                            in capital machinery. The only foreign investment this may deter is in
                            land-banking, which does not significantly add to New Zealand’s productive
                            potential. I am fine with deterring it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My third response to this contention is to posit that it is really a
                            non-problem. Tools at common law, like caveats on property titles, make it
                            entirely possible for owners to limit the use of their land into the
                            future, in exchange for a lower sale price (because future buyers can use
                            the land for less), restoring those very same property rights that existed
                            before. Now, however, they would required to pay for the privilege. As
                            discussed above, if a neighbour valued his view more than the market valued
                            the flexibility to build on that section, he could pay the owner of it to
                            caveat his land to prevent his view from being built out. Therefore, where
                            is it was ‘efficient’ to limit building on a given section, such limits
                            could be taken out.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another criticism is contingent on this policy lowering house prices
                            significantly. This is far from unlikely – as the Superu/Lee report made
                            clear, the regulations I would abolish have driven up the price of housing
                            substantially. Such a price decrease, some suggest, would have significant
                            and negative impacts on the stability of New Zealand’s financial sector,
                            because loans backed by homes are a significant portion of the capital of
                            New Zealand banks, and on the financial situation of many New Zealanders. I
                            would contest this criticism on multiple grounds.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Firstly, a <em>rapid</em> decline in house prices is probably unlikely.
                            Although speculation could make the fall occur faster, the full adjustment
                            process in the market would take a few years at least. There is a
                            significant backlog of houses that must be built and, even with this and
                            the other policies I discuss next, houses take time to build.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Secondly, it is implausible that even if such a dramatic price fall did
                            occur, it would have such severe stability impacts. The prudential
                            regulation of the Reserve Bank (RBNZ) – for instance, through loan-to-value
                            ratio (LVR) requirements which limit low-deposit lending - and the
                            generally conservative approach of the Big Four Australian banks have meant
                            that housing exposure has been managed relatively well. A 2017 stress test
                            by the RBNZ (Lilly, 2018) found that the four banks were well-able to deal
                            with a 35% collapse in residential house prices (at the same time as many
                            other severe economic conditions, including a significant downturn in dairy
                            and tourism and a quick rise in unemployment). This suggests there is
                            little to be concerned about on the financial stability front.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, the concerns about individual New Zealanders are probably more
                            merited. Many New Zealanders have not saved for their retirement in
                            traditional vehicles like shares and bonds but rather by paying down their
                            mortgages<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a>. Many,
                            particularly in Auckland, also hold loans issued before or in exemption
                            from the loan-to-value ratio (LVR) restrictions which, with a significant
                            fall in prices, could make them fall into negative equity. A significant
                            fall in house prices could therefore impact these people quite pointedly.
                            However, this impact would only be pointed if they wished to exit their
                            house and cash out their investment in it. They would continue to be able
                            to live in their house without a mortgage. Lower house prices too would
                            help those people in finding cheaper housing once they had cashed out their
                            investment in their more expensive house.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In general, a more liberal approach to land-use regulation would
                            significantly improve the ability of our housing market to respond to
                            future demand. It would reduce the problems of poverty and inequality
                            caused by the current housing crisis. In addition, it would significantly
                            improve productivity – allowing businesses and housing to be situated where
                            it is most efficient rather than where council plans allow them to be.

                            Land use reform is the most vital change we could make but other areas of
                            the housing market do need reform. Despite land accounting for 60% of the
                            cost of the average Auckland home, construction sector costs <a href="#_ftn4"
                                name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a> are important in driving
                            up prices because they have increased at a rate far surpassing inflation.
                            So too are the incentive structures created by the local government tax
                            system. The latter is covered in the later Taxation chapter.

                        <p>
                            Building material costs in New Zealand are significantly higher than in the
                            rest of the world. Somewhat higher prices are to be expected, given we are
                            subject to the dual tyrannies of distance and a small population, but the
                            market is structured in such a way to make competition difficult, thereby
                            keeping prices unnaturally high.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As a small, distant market, New Zealand is quite an unattractive option for
                            firms looking to expand. If we want competition in our markets, we must
                            reduce any artificial barriers to entry, because the natural barriers are
                            high enough. In building materials, these artificial barriers are generally
                            building materials regulation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We have an independent building materials certification process which is
                            very costly for overseas and new firms to undertake – meaning they are less
                            likely to join our market and provide natural competition to the
                            incumbents.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Instead, we should recognize the expertise of foreign regulators. Building
                            authorities in Japan and the West Coast of the United States are very
                            experienced with regulating materials for coastal and seismically-active
                            environments very similar to ours. We should trust them and allow, by
                            default all building materials which have been approved for use in those
                            jurisdictions with similar conditions to ours and quality regulatory
                            regimes. Of course, we should retain a domestic supervisory capability to
                            ensure we can approve New Zealand-developed innovations and remove consent
                            for those materials which have been flawed in our conditions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The greatest objections to this policy will probably come from the domestic
                            incumbents. Such a policy would allow competitors to emerge and break their
                            duopoly. They would possibly complain of job losses. We can be assured,
                            however, that the benefits accruing to each homeowner would sum to far
                            greater than the losses to the incumbents – this is the basic fact of
                            competition.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Some, however, may also question the expertise of the foreign inspectors.
                            This seems to me a trifle arrogant: As custodians of far larger markets,
                            they are probably far more experienced with consenting innovative and
                            diverse products than our own regime, whose track record was significantly
                            damaged by the leaky-homes saga.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A policy of overseas regulation recognition would dramatically lower entry
                            costs for competitors to Fletcher’s and Winstone and allow competition to
                            emerge far easier and prices to fall, at no cost to safety.
                        </p>

                            Some will tell you that the housing crisis is a market failure. This is
                            fundamentally wrong: The failure in the market for housing is one of
                            government overregulation and mismanagement. With less distortionary
                            policies and more choice, we can allow building to occur, we can return to
                            housing sanity.

                                    In Coase (1960)’s aforementioned paper on bargaining of this sort,
                                    he proposes two common issues which make reaching efficient
                                    solutions difficult: 1) the presence of significant transaction
                                    costs; and 2) the lack of clearly defined property rights. Neither
                                    of those is significant in this situation. On transaction costs <strong>:</strong>
                                    Sure, the costs of negotiation might be high –
                                    lawyers fees, for instance. But when taken in context, considering
                                    the value of the property being discussed, they would be relatively
                                    negligible. The property rights concern is mitigated by the new <em>Development
                                        Act</em>, which would make it clear that the
                                    property right lies with the landowner.
