                        <p>
                                Immigration is an important contributor to our economy. As a small growing
                                nation there is no way we could possibly provide enough skilled labour from
                                the current population stock to maintain the current rate of growth in the
                                economy and in living standards. Immigrants also provide a buffer against
                                our ageing population, contributing to their healthcare and Superannuation
                                through significant net tax contributions. The current approach, however,
                                is flawed.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The current system assigns to the Government responsibility for determining
                                what occupations need immigrant labour the most. This it does through
                                various visa programs and lists of in-demand occupations like the Long-Term
                                Skill Shortage List. Our immigration system is centrally planned.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Given its poor record in running economies, why should we believe central
                                planning is a decent way of running an immigration system? It has resulted
                                in absurdities like tour guides being our most-imported occupation
                            (Swasbrook &amp; Hickey, 2016). Surely, some of the 14,400 New Zealanders    <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> who have been unemployed
                                for over a year could be trained for these positions. At the same time,
                                other professions remain stubbornly in shortage – many, like teaching, have
                                many qualified foreign workers who would love to work in New Zealand
                                available. Treasury and Immigration officials, no matter how smart, do not
                                have adequate information to make an informed decision on where immigrants
                                would be most valuable to our economy.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                At this point some, particularly my fellow libertarians, would suggest the
                                State simply step aside and permit unlimited immigration. This is an idea
                                with significant pedigree. The Economist, for instance, have recently
                                campaigned in favour of open borders – suggesting the global economic gains
                                would exceed US$3 trillion if it was adopted worldwide. Jeffrey Miron, one
                                of the economists I most admire and the Director of Undergraduate Studies
                                in economics at Harvard, has recently argued for them on behalf of the
                            venerable Cato Institute (Miron, 2018). I will admit that,    <em>prima facie</em>, this idea has significant personal appeal to me. It
                                does not, however, measure up.

                            </h2>
                            <p>
                                The State is entirely within its rights to restrict new entrants to
                                preserve the lifestyles of incumbent residents. The social contract exists
                                between the current residents of the State and their government, because
                                those current residents are the only ones who have given up their freedoms
                                to that state in return for its protection. Foreigners, who have given no
                                freedoms to that state, are not as entitled to its protection.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The question, therefore, becomes whether allowing unlimited immigration
                                would improve or worsen the lifestyles of incumbent residents. Consider if
                                New Zealand was the only country to unilaterally remove its immigration
                                controls. This is the only proposal on the table. Open borders worldwide
                                are certainly not just around the corner – the immigration anxiety
                                displayed in America’s election of President Trump and the British vote to
                                leave the European Union has made sure of that. In this world of unilateral
                                free movement into New Zealand, how many people would move here? There are
                                billions whose lives would be significantly improved if they lived in a
                                country like ours: almost 6.6 billion people live in countries with a GDP
                                per capita of less than <strong>half</strong> of New Zealand’s. If we were
                                the only similar country to open our borders, a significant proportion of
                                those people would come to New Zealand. I have the utmost sympathy for
                                those who are seeking higher wages and a better living environment for
                                their families, but we simply could not accommodate them and maintain our
                                present standard of living. Yes, there exists a self-regulating mechanism
                                whereby if the population becomes so high that the living standards are
                                worsened, fewer immigrants will come. Still, however, a worse New Zealand
                                is significantly better than most of the world and people will still come.
                                With a significant influx of migrants, even my most liberal housing policy
                                would struggle. We would be essentially required to build on some of our
                                most precious national parks and to endure significant congestion in our
                                major cities – at least until infrastructure can be built, which even with
                                a significantly increased population is not a doddle. Air and water quality
                                would surely suffer. The costs of open borders on the most policy-relevant
                                – i.e., present New Zealand residents - are therefore significant.

                                We are thus left with no option but to restrict who may live and work in
                                this country. Central planning has not worked and will never work. Instead,
                                we should use the price system to allocate immigration permits.
                                Essentially, we should sell the right to live and work in New Zealand.

                                There are two options available to us. The Government could:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                a) limit the <u>quantity</u> of immigrants allowed into the country and
                                allow the price to float (a visa auction); or,
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                b) set the <u>price</u> of immigration and allow the number to be set by
                                the market (an immigration tariff).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                These options mirror those available to us in the Environment section.
                                There, setting the quantity of allowed carbon emissions would require an
                                emissions trading scheme, while setting the price of carbon emissions would
                                require a carbon tax.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Which we choose depends on how we prefer the uncertainty inherent in any
                                market-based allocation to manifest. In an auction, the Government (and
                                infrastructure planners) is given certainty about the number of immigrants
                                they must account for. However, firms (and immigrants) face uncertainty
                                about the price of immigration. This makes it more difficult for them to
                                plan their future labour costs. In a tariff model, the opposite is true.
                                Government, and infrastructure planners, are given little certainty about
                                the number of immigrants who will enter the country, while firms (and
                                immigrants) can know for certain how expensive it will be to immigrate to
                                New Zealand. In both cases, the Government has no certainty about the
                                amount of revenue it will receive from the system – either the price or
                                quantity will vary.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It also depends on which we think the Government can calculate more
                                accurately. Is the government better equipped to know how many immigrants
                                society can absorb in the next period or how much each immigrant costs in
                                an external sense? Note, however, that either of these decisions would only
                                be short-lived. If, for instance, government set the number of immigrants
                                permitted too low and the auction price was very high, they could alter the
                                number of permits available at the next auction.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In my view, auctions satisfy both of these tests better. What the level of
                                immigration which is politically acceptable and economically viable in a
                                given period is much more easily determined by government than the right
                                price. For one, it recognises that the net cost of immigrants depends on
                                their quantity. The first immigrant let in in any system will not impose a
                            significant cost of our economy and will be of very high value. The 50,000    <sup>th</sup>, however, may be less valuable (all of the jobs which are
                                crucial to fill will have already been filled by the 49,999 previous
                                immigrants). Additionally, the uncertainty falling on firms is not
                                necessarily a negative. It could encourage firms not to rely on immigrant
                                labour as a guaranteed source of labour and simply budget for the tariff.
                                Instead, firms may seek to mitigate the risk that they will not be able to
                                afford immigrant labour in the future by investing in skills growth or
                                productivity-enhancing capital investment in New Zealand.

                                The Government should hold auctions regularly (perhaps, quarterly) for an
                                announced number of fixed-term permits (for instance, for 5 years) to work
                                in New Zealand. These auctions should be open to any New Zealand employer
                                who wishes to hire an overseas resident, any overseas individual who wishes
                                to move to New Zealand, or any foreigner resident in New Zealand whose visa
                                was due to expire. The Crown should also facilitate a secondary market for
                                these permits. Employers who no longer required a permit, because their
                                employee had left, for instance, could resell these permits on the open
                                market. Individuals who decided to move to another country could sell their
                                permit and allow another immigrant to take their remaining tenure in New
                                Zealand. However, these permits should begin counting as soon as they are
                                purchased, to reduce arbitrage between times of high and low demand and
                                allow authorities to predict population growth more accurately.

                                Workers who come to New Zealand on such auctions should still be subject to
                                national security screening. Pre-screening on auction participants, for
                                instance, would prohibit those with violent crime convictions or
                                connections with terrorist organizations from even participating in the
                                auction. They should also not be eligible for State welfare subsidies – for
                                instance, free treatment in public hospitals and domestic fees at public
                                schools and universities. This would avoid individuals from benefit
                                shopping and, for instance, paying a below-market price to receive medical
                                treatment in New Zealand. They should also be subject to deportation if
                                convicted of a criminal offence. They should, however, be eligible for New
                                Zealand Permanent Residency. After a period exceeding at least two ‘fixed
                                periods’ (e.g., two 5-year terms), such people have clearly demonstrated a
                                longstanding commitment to New Zealand and should be treated as New
                                Zealanders, for most purposes. After a period as Permanent Residents, they
                                should also be eligible for consideration to acquire New Zealand
                                Citizenship.

                                Such a system has many benefits. Firstly, and most obviously, it allocates
                                visas to the areas of the economy in which they are most valuable. Those
                                who bid the most for immigration permits obviously value immigrant labour
                                more than anyone else. This suggests a significant shortage of domestic
                                labour in that industry. Other industries, however, where immigrant labour
                                is less valuable will not gain immigration permits. Therefore, our limited
                                capacity to accept immigration will be filled by the most useful
                                immigrants.

                                Secondly, it provides a price signal to the government. As it stands,
                                government lack for strong signals on whether to increase or decrease the
                                number of immigration permits allowed. They must rely on rival claims by
                                employers’ lobbyists and anti-immigration campaigners. When a price for
                                immigration is revealed, the Government can use the changes in this figure
                                to note changes in the demand for immigration. This would allow them, when
                                this price far exceeds the cost of serving new immigrants, to invest in
                                providing capacity for an influx and then increase the number of permits
                                available.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Crucially too, a permit system shifts the burden of the negative external
                                costs of immigration to those who benefit from it. Currently, the external
                                costs of immigration, like increased pressure on our infrastructure, are
                                borne by all taxpayers. So too are the intangible costs, for instance, the
                                crowding of limited public spaces in nature. It is fairer that those who
                                benefit from immigration – i.e., employers and the consumers of the goods
                                they produce and the immigrants themselves – are required to pay for these
                                costs they impose on every New Zealander.

                                A permit-based immigration system is not putting our citizenship up for
                                sale. Rather, it ensures that, given the limited number of immigrants we
                                can reasonably accept, those immigrants are the most able to contribute to
                                New Zealand society.
