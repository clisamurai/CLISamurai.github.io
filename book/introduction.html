                        <p>
                            New Zealand’s politics were once said to be “socialism with no doctrine”
                            (Métin, 1901). This was undoubtedly more accurate than not for a very long
                            time. New Zealand governments constantly intervened in favour of this
                            industry or that<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. In 1984,
                            however, a Labour government tore down the socialist monolith which the New
                            Zealand economy had become. Encouraged by a severe crisis in the public
                            finances, David Lange and Sir Roger Douglas orchestrated a plan of radical
                            reform, which tore down a staid state-controlled society and replaced it
                            with a vibrant, metropolitan, and free-trading economy. Ours was the first
                            transition economy, successfully copied in much of the former Soviet Bloc.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Unfortunately, despite this courageous effort and the success of the next
                            National government – Ruth Richardson, in particular – in extending these
                            reforms to the inefficient and malfunctioning labour market, our nation
                            remains shackled to inefficient and burdensome government policies. We are
                            the 3<sup>rd</sup> freest economy in the world (Heritage Foundation, 2018),
                            but it is our most vital (for the future) industries which are dominated by
                            government – for example, housing, education, retirement savings, and
                            healthcare. This is behind our substandard productivity growth and the
                            problems we face, as a nation: child poverty, expanding inequality,
                            unsustainable entitlement programmes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This book represents my effort to identify the root causes and ideal
                            reforms for these problems.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Of course, as you may have sensed from the previous paragraphs, I do not
                            come at these issues from a place of political neutrality. I am unabashedly
                            a liberal – in the European sense. I believe, generally, in J.S. Mill’s
                            conception of government as an agent for protection against others, not
                            against oneself (Mill, 1859). I subscribe to F. A. Hayek’s view of the
                            market as the best coordinator of our disperse resources and knowledge
                            (Hayek, 1945). I share the innate liberal distrust of centralized power and
                            belief in the primacy of the individual over the collective. These
                            philosophical priors do indeed influence my choice of policy proposals, but
                            they should not disqualify my analysis or solutions proposed from
                            consideration by others, be they social democrats or conservatives, because
                            the ideas have identities separate from their author.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Before the main body of the text begins, I should mention that many of the
                            reforms proposed here are far from politically ‘practical’, in the current
                            context. As the title suggests, these are radical propositions. In this
                            book, I step away from the incrementalism favoured by New Zealand’s major
                            political parties and ignore the search for the views of the median voter.
                            Instead, I search for real solutions. Of course, I would prefer that these
                            solutions be adopted in their entirety, but even incremental movement
                            towards their fundamental tenets would be desirable.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            What follows is a dissection of each of the policy areas I see significant
                            reforms as needed. My approach to each policy area may differ depending on
                            the depth of treatment it requires. Generally, however, I shall outline the
                            flaws and benefits of the status quo, including their effects on the wider
                            problems New Zealand faces, and then, when appropriate, consider
                            alternative policies, drawing from international experience and academic
                            evidence. For each policy area, I shall conclude by outlining my ideal
                            reform.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I should also follow the example of Lord Bingham in his excellent book The
                            Rule of Law (2011) and offer my apologies at the beginning for my habit of
                            using the masculine singular pronouns (he/his/him) to refer to singular
                            people of indeterminate gender. This, in my view, avoids the
                            ungrammaticality of the ‘they/them/their’ construction and the inelegance
                            of ‘he or she’. The male pronoun should, unless context otherwise requires,
                            be taken to include the female.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I should also note that parts of this publication have been adapted from
                            previous work of mine. In particular, research and writing I produced for
                            my abortive attempt at starting a thinktank has been used. So too have
                            speeches and blogposts I have written. Significant research and some
                            content from my essay written for the Mont Pelerin Society’s Hayek
                            Fellowship essay competition has also been adopted. Where previously
                            written and currently published work has been directly adapted, this will
                            be noted in a footnote. My thanks must go to those who assisted in my
                            research and drafting for those pieces.
                        </p>

                            I hope you enjoy this book, but most of all I hope it compels greater
                            discussion of the underlying issues behind New Zealand’s woes. These issues
                            are going to affect my generation for our entire lifetimes and they (and
                            we) deserve solutions.
