            <p>
              New Zealand is a prosperous country. By almost every (reasonable) metric, this is one of the greatest
              countries in the world to live in.
              But behind that outward success lies longlived societal challenges which have dogged governments for
              decades: A dysfunctional housing market,
              an unequal education system, anaemic productivity growth, and an unsustainable retirement system are a few
              of the more high-profile complaints.
              Fiddling around the edges won't be enough. Instead, we need a fundamental reimagining of many crucial
              sectors.
            </p>
            <p>That is what this book (read: web draft of a book) attempts to architect. It provides a policy programme
              which attacks the root causes of those societal ills.
              I have actively modelled that programme on the highly-successful structural reforms of the Fourth Labour
              Government in New Zealand in the 1980s, those
              of Australian Labour during a similar period, and those of Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government,
              also in the 1980s. They are unashamedly liberal in origin
              and aim, before all else, to increase the freedom of individual New Zealanders to achieve their own
              ambitions. </p>
            <p>This programme, I recognise, is probably supported, in its entirety, by no-one except me. What I hope,
              however, is that it can marginally shift
              the terms of policy debate in the broad direction of liberalisation and reform.

              Note to Readers
            </h4>
            <p>This is a very preliminary draft of <i>Radical Reform</i> (which isn't even certain to be the final title). Please
            excuse any errors &mdash; spelling or grammatical especially, factual less so &mdash; as a result of haste. I would be very grateful for feedback, at
            mp (at) mitchellpalmer.nz</p>
            <p>I would also like to make an apology in advance: As a result of its draft status, the handling of referencing within this web version of the book is less than ideal. 
              Every parenthetically referenced work should also be cited in the bibliography, however links between the bibliography and the main body of the text do not currently work. 
              My thanks to all whose work I have consulted and quoted from.
            </p>
