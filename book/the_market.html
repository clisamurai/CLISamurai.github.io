                        <p>
                            Most of the policies I shall propose herein are based on market mechanisms.
                            They are, as is the fashionable name amongst many scholars for anything
                            they dislike, neoliberal. It is, therefore, useful to start by quickly
                            outlining the case for the market allocation of resources. Otherwise, I
                            would be repeating myself, ad nauseam, throughout. My apologies to those
                            who are familiar with the typical arguments for the free market: There is
                            little original in the next chapter.

                            <a name="_Toc532648080">What is the Market</a>
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            For a roughly dictionary definition: The market is the interaction of
                            willing and, typically, profit-seeking or utility-maximising individuals
                            (and firms, being collections of individuals) in the exchange of limited
                            resources. In a typical product market this looks like producers attempting
                            to meet consumer demands at the lowest possible cost. Generally, in a
                            monetary economy like ours, what the ‘demands’ of consumers and the costs
                            facing producers are is expressed in terms of prices.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Prices are the core element of a modern market. They are expressions of
                            relative scarcity. Prices increase when, holding the amount producers are
                            willing or able to provide constant, consumers want more of the product.
                            They decrease when producers are willing or able to make more of them. They
                            also decrease when consumers want less of them and increase when producers
                            become less willing or able to make them. In economic terms, they are
                            determined by the supply and demand for the product.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But why do they work? Higher prices suggest that there is demand for the
                            product. If those prices exceed the cost of producing the product <a href="#_ftn1"
                                name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>, entrepreneurs will enter
                            to earn the difference – profit. Why? Because that profit increases their
                            own purchasing power to purchase more of what they want. And if the price
                            is below the cost of producing the product, they will exit the market – it
                            is no longer profitable. And if the price of inputs change, this can change
                            behaviour. For instance, when the price of oil increases – because there is
                            more scarcity in the market, airlines both increase prices (driving people
                            away, and reducing demand for oil in a time when it is scarce –
                            reallocating it only to its highest value uses) and invest in fuel-saving
                            technology (moving away from the newly scarce resource). The price of any
                            given thing is “a signal wrapped up in an incentive” (Tabarrok, 2015). The
                            function of the price system is for the community to, as Adam Smith – the
                            father of modern economics – said, “interest the self-love” (1977, p. 30)
                            of the entrepreneur in doing what they require. After all, “it is not from
                            the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect
                            our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest.” (Smith, 1977, p.
                            30)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Note, however, the use of prices to incentivise useful behaviour
                            necessarily creates inequality. This is inescapable: If we were all
                            materially equal, no matter our contribution – why would we contribute? We
                            would receive the same reward if we did or didn’t. And even if we did
                            decide to contribute, if there is no incentive to make the most valuable
                            use of our time, instead we might waste our potential in a less useful
                            path. Thus naturally, a world without inequality is a world of tremendous
                            waste<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>. This need for
                            material inequality does not, of course, justify abject poverty. In a rich
                            country such as ours, we must collectively insure each other against the
                            scourge of poverty. A well-designed welfare state – as I propose in the
                            later section on taxation and welfare – can do so without destroying the
                            incentive to contribute to the maximum of one’s potential.

                        <p>
                            The simple moral argument for the market was best said by Milton Friedman:
                            “[In] a free market…no exchange takes place unless both parties benefit”
                            (Friedman, 2000). This, in and of itself, should justify most market
                            transactions. There are, really, only three reasonable objections to market
                            transactions conducted in this manner:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>1) </strong>
                            <strong>
                                The transaction affects innocent third-parties negatively
                                (externalities),
                            </strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Clearly, it is not within the scope of any person’s freedom to harm another
                            without their consent<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a>.
                            However, it is not inherently impossible for a private negotiation to reach
                            an adequate settlement for such issues. In Coase (1960)’s masterful paper
                            on bargaining of this sort, he suggests that it is, often, quite possible.
                            His example, of a cattle ranch next to a crop farm, remains the most
                            famous: The rancher’s cows regularly trespass onto the neighbour’s farm and
                            destroy crops. It could be efficient for the farmer to pay rancher to move,
                            the rancher to pay the farmer for the lost crops, or they both to pay for a
                            fence in the middle. Which is the best option depends on the relative
                            prices of the cows, the crops, and the mitigation method. Coase showed that
                            private negotiation would find the most efficient way to resolve this
                            externality problem.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            He also proposed two common issues which make reaching efficient solutions
                            difficult: 1) the presence of significant transaction costs; and 2) the
                            lack of clearly defined property rights. These first of these problems
                            often come up when the external costs (or benefits) of a given transaction
                            are dispersed between many people. For instance, the cost to each
                            individual of the pollution of a factory which might cause acid rain are
                            relatively negligible, but the total costs are significant. This means
                            that, while it would be efficient to make the polluter to compensate its
                            neighbours for the pollution, it will not occur because the costs of
                            coordinating them all and providing them with legal representation (the
                            transaction costs) outweigh the possible benefit to the neighbours.
                            Government action is justified here. The second problem is rarer. It
                            emerges when it not clear who has the right to do what they will – the
                            person who experiences the negative externality or the person contributing
                            it. For instance, do smokers have the right to smoke or others the right to
                            smoke free air? The answer to that question decides who pays whom (but not
                            what is the efficient outcome). Typically, however, governments (and
                            courts) settle to whom these property rights belong very early on. <strong></strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>2) </strong>
                            <strong>
                                The transaction was conducted fraudulently, under duress, or by an
                                incompetent party.

                            Part of the assumption of the morality of the free market is that it is
                            conducted by people considered competent to deal with their own affairs.
                            Children, some of the mentally-ill, those being deceived or held prisoner
                            (or under blackmail) cannot be considered competent to conduct (some or
                            all) transactions. Government must prohibit such transactions. <strong></strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>3) </strong>
                            <strong>
                                The transaction was unfairly structured, so that one party got a worse
                                deal that he should have.
                            </strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                The archetypal example of this scenario is monopolism. When the
                                producer is the only provider of a certain good or service and no
                                competitor is able to emerge, he can take advantage of this situation
                                and produce at a higher price and lower quantity that he otherwise would in a free market. Here,
                                government might have a case to intervene. However, it is possible that
                                government action could have more deleterious long-term effects. For
                                instance, poor price-setting could worsen the monopoly situation or
                                reduce the incentive for the monopoly to invest in research and
                                development. Badly-planned intervention in the market, like
                                nationalization or compulsory divestment of certain parts of a
                                business, could led to more inefficiency and could deter foreign
                                investment, because investors could be afraid for the safety of their
                                own investments.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another example of this is monopsonic labour markets. Here, one predominant
                            employer dominates the labour market for a certain class of employee or for
                            a certain location and uses this power to set wages at
                            lower-than-free-market rates and hire fewer workers than they otherwise
                            would. Government intervention here, for instance, in providing additional
                            power to unions (to create a monopoly to counter the monopsony) or setting
                            a minimum wage can be useful – however, again, possibly seriously
                            deleterious if poorly done.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are other moral arguments against the free market which I believe are
                            quite flawed. For instance, the view that people regularly make poor
                            decisions and require paternalistic governments to ensure their
                            decision-making is proper. My principal moral objection to this is that it
                            requires a belief that others have ownership over the individual. Surely,
                            excluding the cases where they are literally incapable of rational decision
                            making, the individual is the whole and exclusive owner of himself and
                            therefore, should be permitted to do what he pleases with himself. The view
                            that his life is the property of others or that he owes duties, inherently,
                            to others is slavish<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a>.

                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            As laid out above, the price system incentivises individuals – who, above
                            all, serve their own self-interest – to generally work for the wider
                            benefit of society. Compare this to the incentives operating on a central
                            planner. His notional duty is to best serve the interests of the community,
                            but, as the entire field of public choice economics can attest to <a href="#_ftn6"
                                name="_ftnref6" title="">[6]</a>, this is often in
                            fundamental conflict with his natural instinct to serve his own. At best,
                            the entire planning staff will be comprised of entirely self-sacrificing
                            individuals who have no consideration for their own interest – a wonderful,
                            if entirely unrealistic, vision. More realistically, they might be
                            reasonably-public minded people, who still cannot escape occasionally
                            temptations to prefer their own interests to that of the public-at-large –
                            the example of the public service unions occurs. Worse, they could be like
                            Sir Humphrey Appleby in Yes Minister: Broadly competent but entirely
                            uncommitted to the public interest. At worst, they could be corrupt –
                            siphoning public funds or handing out cushy government contracts, not
                            merely in violation of the public interest but in direct violation of the
                            law.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Democratic accountability is meant to provide a bulwark against this. The
                            threat of losing office is thought to ensure politicians are competent and
                            benevolent and ensure the same behaviour from their underlings.
                            Unfortunately, as lovely as it sounds, democratic accountability is
                            woefully weak, compared to the harsh accountability of the market. For one,
                            it is not in the interest of most voters to consider their votes, because
                            the cost of becoming informed is high and the possible benefit is small –
                            it is very unlikely that one’s vote would change the result, even in a
                            small country such as ours. Public choice economists call this rational
                            ignorance. Secondly, in a political market of constrained choice (there are
                            13 registered parties in New Zealand (Electoral Commission, 2018), of which
                            only seven had a reasonable chance of making it into Parliament in the 2017
                            election), accountability is unlikely to be exercised by most voters, who
                            are committed to a certain ideological position, except in the most serious
                            of cases. Thirdly, there exists an exit-option, but it is severely limited.
                            It is far from costless to simply shift countries to avoid bad policies <a href="#_ftn7"
                                name="_ftnref7" title="">[7]</a>. By contrast, in most
                            markets, there are competitors to a consumer’s incumbent provider who is
                            easy enough to access. It is also in the consumer’s interest to exercise
                            this accountability: Even if their move does not change the position of
                            their former provider, it does allow them to access better service
                            immediately.

                            The very chance of the planner being a Sir Humphrey Appleby-type or worse
                            speaks to one of the core problems of planning, when compared to
                            market-based interactions: The lack of choice inherent in government. An
                            incompetent or even malfeasant administrator is obviously suboptimal, but
                            when choice exists, it need not be disastrous. Consumers will simply, in
                            their own self-interest, move away from the bad provider. When enough do
                            so, the poor provider will collapse.

                        <p>
                            The existence of competitors in the marketplace is crucial <a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9"
                                title="">[9]</a>. It alters the power
                            dynamics of the market in favour of consumers. When multiple firms compete
                            for a consumer’s business, the consumer becomes sovereign: He can demand
                            higher quality, lower prices, and goods which better match his needs –
                            because he can move providers. It also encourages what Schumpeter called
                            ‘creative destruction’. He proposed that competition is a process whereby
                            the less productive firms are “incessantly destroy[ed]” to make way and
                            free up resources for newer, more productive firms, which better match
                            consumer desires (1942, p. 83). By contrast, planners – and government –
                            are almost always monopolies. The consumer is not sovereign, the planner
                            is.

                        <p>
                            The best (and probably, original) statement of this argument for the free
                            market comes from Hayek in his ingenious essay, The Use of Knowledge in
                            Society (1945). There, Hayek sings the praises of the market as a
                            coordinative agent, principally by comparing the information available to a
                            board of central planners with that available to the market.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            No central planner can possibly have the information available to him that
                            each individual has. Individuals are the ones directly aware of their own
                            circumstances. Just as when you zoom out of a map you lose clarity on any
                            one point, when you make decisions at an aggregated level you cannot
                            possibly account for all the individual concerns of every New Zealand
                            household<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title="">[10]</a>. Sure,
                            consumers might not be entirely rational in all of their decision making
                            all the time, but on big decisions, generally individuals consider their
                            own value system adequately and make boundedly-rational decisions far
                            better than a civil servant, who knew little of their unique circumstances,
                            could.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In addition, Hayek (2002) in a later lecture argued competition between
                            firms in the market is a ‘discovery procedure’, allowing individuals to
                            discover how to best serve one another. This discovery occurs by the
                            creation of ideas or the expression of disperse knowledge, which is
                            incentivised by the search for profit. There is then competition between
                            operators of those ideas or that knowledge on the marketplace for
                            consumers. Eventually, operators will converge, either through poor
                            performers atrophying or moving to the better model, around the best ideas.
                            In the absence of competition, knowledge that may prove useful in, for
                            instance, improving quality, lowering costs, or better matching consumer
                            demand will remain unknown because no incentive exists to invent or
                            discover it, or no system exists to test it against other ideas or
                            knowledge. This, really, is at the heart of the outperformance of the
                            market: It incentivises invention.

                                    children. Parents owe a duty to their children because they are
                                    responsible for bringing them into life. When they chose to have
                                    children, they chose to accept what is, essentially, an 18-year
                                    trusteeship over a human life. The trust has as its beneficiary the
                                    future adult child. Here, they are slaves not to other people but
                                    to their prior selves who took on the obligation of trusteeship.

                                    Herein lies the case for decentralising government power, not
                                    merely to consumers but also to smaller units of local government.
                                    Unfortunately, the pool of skilled politicians and of media
                                    available to hold politicians to account is, in my view, too small
                                    for this lesson to be applied in New Zealand.

                                    The exact extent to which you, as the present-giver, care about the
                                    quality of the present depends on the accountability mechanism the
                                    gift holder has over you and the extent to which your own utility
                                    function (read, happiness) includes their utility (i.e., how much
                                    you care how they feel). If they are a close friend or family
                                    member and can make you feel guilty if you buy a bad gift or will
                                    reward you if you purchase a good one, you will naturally care
                                    more. Unfortunately, in government, there exists little
                                    accountability, as I laid out in the preceding paragraph.

                                    competition.

                                    This metaphor is stolen from my previous work, Why New Zealand
