                            Drug laws are in a worldwide state of flux. Many nations and subnational
                            jurisdictions have begun to reform their drug laws, mostly beginning with
                            cannabis. However, New Zealand, normally a bastion of liberalization, is
                            stuck in 1970s.

                        <p>
                            Drug liberalisation is a global trend for good reason: we are finally
                            realizing that Nixon’s War on Drugs has been a failure. Many nations have
                            made significant progress already: Portugal decriminalized all drugs in
                            2001 while states across the United States – including the largest,
                            California - have begun to legalize cannabis for medical and recreational
                            usage. New Zealand, on the other hand, lags behind.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is true that our drug laws have less significant progress to make than
                            those of other nations. We, for example, have cannabis scheduled under
                            Class C of our Misuse of Drugs Act while the United States has it,
                            nonsensically, listed in Schedule I of their Controlled Substances Act
                            above substances like cocaine and amphetamines. But still, we can improve.
                        </p>

                            Why should Kiwis go to jail at all – even if it is only for 3 months – for
                            taking a substance that has no lethal dosage like marijuana? Or one that is
                            harmful only to themselves? This is an inefficient use of our expensive
                            prison system which – according to Corrections data - costs over $110,000
                            per year, per prisoner (Hurley, 2018). It is also a massive waste of police
                            resources. As Georgetown law professor Randy Barnett so laconically put it,
                            “Every hour spent investigating a drug user or seller is an hour that could
                            have been used to find a missing child.” (Barnett, 2009)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The criminalization of narcotics is an entirely counterproductive policy,
                            which makes the state guilty – essentially – of culpable homicide. Here, I
                            shall leave aside my analysis of the general problems with mass
                            incarceration – which is entirely applicable here and can be found in the
                            previous Crime and Justice chapter – and focus on the particular problems
                            with and alternative approaches to drug prohibition.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As Friedman suggests above, the criminalization of drugs functions as
                            government protection of the drug cartels and organized crime. The lack of
                            legal dispute settlement means the only people who can compete in the drugs
                            market are those with a propensity to look after their own interests,
                            including violently if necessary. That drug dealers are not able to report
                            crimes against them means competition, rather than being on price and
                            quality, sometimes ends up as violent turf battles for control of certain
                            selling territories. A Ministry of Health-commissioned study (McFadden
                            Consultancy, 2016) found that organized crime proceeds from the sale of
                            illicit drugs in New Zealand totalled $629 million in 2015, of which $70.4
                            million was reinvested into further criminal activity.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The prohibition of drugs also incentivises the creation of new, more potent
                            narcotics – like the synthetic cannabinoids which are currently the subject
                            of great public distress. As it is quite difficult to transport illicit
                            drugs, because of enforcement actions, users wish to get as high as
                            possible (and dealers wish to make as much money as possible) from the
                            smallest possible package. Therefore, producers increase the potency of
                            their drugs. Such high potency drugs are far more dangerous because
                            overdosing requires only a small mistake in measuring quantities. This
                            phenomenon is so predictable it has been called the Iron Law of
                            Prohibition: “the harder the enforcement, the harder the drugs” (Cowan,
                            1986).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We saw this Iron Law play out during the United States’ alcohol Prohibition
                            (Thornton, 1991). Many users switched from the beer and wine that were
                            common before and after Prohibition to spirits, which were far easier to
                            carry surreptitiously: Spirits jumped from accounting for approximately 40%
                            of alcohol sales to almost 90% in the first year of Prohibition. This led
                            to the entirely unintended consequence that per-capita alcohol consumption,
                            as measured by equivalent quantities of pure alcohol, actually increased
                            during Prohibition (Warburton, 1932), with all the social consequences that
                            entails, and which Prohibitionists sought to combat. The same hard-f0r-soft
                            substitution is occurring in New Zealand’s drug market.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another sad consequence of drug prohibition is its effect on user safety.
                            If a distillery created an impure alcohol mixture that threatened user
                            safety, it would be prosecuted and held accountable. Even if it wasn’t
                            legally punished, its patronage would fall dramatically as soon as this
                            reality made the newspaper. Unfortunately, such impurities and false
                            advertising are common in the illegal drugs market and consumers have no
                            recourse to seek reparations – the Consumer Guarantees Act does not apply
                            to narcotics; they cannot even warn others of the possible dangers of a
                            supplier, for fear of retribution. These concerns are compounded by the
                            reluctance of users and their friends to seek medical assistance when
                            overdoses and other ill-effects of illicit drugs occur, because they are
                            afraid of legal consequences.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Those who support the continued criminalization of drugs justify their
                            position by highlighting harm done by drug users to others. If this
                            reasoning were applied rationally and consistently, many other substances
                            and products would be banned. Chief among them would surely be alcohol,
                            managing the harmful use of which takes up 18% of the Police budget
                            (Auckland Regional Public Health Service, 2010). There is zero mainstream
                            support for a return to the flawed era of dry counties and Prohibition.

                        <p>
                            The Government’s new policy to devolve to Police, in law, the
                            responsibility of using ‘discretion’ in deciding whether to prosecute drug
                            crimes is a very poor answer. Discretion to prosecute already exists. The
                            problems of the war of drugs remain. In addition, discretion without
                            judicial oversight may simply amplify the discriminatory outcomes of drug
                            prohibition. Of course, in New Zealand, police officers are overwhelmingly
                            decent public servants. Like all, however, they are subject to unconscious
                            biases, which may effect who they decide to prosecute. This is particularly
                            true when police officers and prosecutors are overwhelmingly exposed to
                            crime committed in certain neighbourhoods and by certain groups. This may
                            breed discriminatory outcomes.

                            prohibition and could disappear with a common-sense drug policy. So, where

                            Switzerland, one of the most conservative countries in Europe, has adopted
                            the least liberal system that I investigated. The Swiss model, however, is
                            still more liberal than New Zealand’s approach. Their policy is summarised
                            as ‘prevention, therapy, harm reduction, and prohibition’. It allows heroin
                            to be used by approved providers in treatment and treats drugs primarily as
                            a health issue. It has successfully achieved its goal of reducing harm from
                            illicit drug usage. The country has cut both HIV infection rates from
                            infected needle usage and overdose mortality in half and significantly
                            reduced user criminality (Csete, 2010). The infamous ‘needle park’ in the
                            centre of Zurich is a thing of the past.
                        </p>

                            The United States, the spiritual home of drug prohibition, has also
                            experimented with liberalization, in individual states. To date, only
                            cannabis has been the subject of significant reform, but many
                            jurisdictions, including the most populous state, California, and the
                            capital district, have fully legalized the drug. This legalization has been
                            successful across the country, with no discernible change in consumption,
                            teen usage in fact decreasing, increased taxation revenue, decreased
                            correctional and law enforcement spending on drug issues and no discernible
                            negative effects on crime, road safety and the economy (Dills, et al.,
                            2016). Given it is marijuana, substantial health effects are probably
                            unlikely.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The most radical example occurred in Portugal in 2001, where the
                            small-scale possession of all drugs was decriminalized. They remained
                            illegal, but the Portuguese government treated the possession of them as a
                            public health matter and an administrative violation rather than a criminal
                            matter. The reforms have been a resounding success. Lifetime prevalence
                            rates of most drugs have decreased since the reforms as have drug-related
                            mortality rates. Compared to the rest of Europe, Portugal in fact has lower
                            cannabis and cocaine prevalence rates for both the overall and youth
                            population (Greenwald, 2009).

                            Unfortunately, no country has adopted Milton Friedman’s preferred model of
                            total legalization for every drug of all classes, so we cannot be sure of
                            the practical outcomes of this. However, we can apply some rational
                            analysis.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With the creation of a safer and legal market, one would expect to see
                            expanded demand for the drugs, from curious individuals who are currently
                            afraid of legal consequences. However, this would probably not be
                            significant for the hard drugs: those who are not concerned about the
                            possible addiction and overdose consequences are probably not significantly
                            deterred by existing legal consequences.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We would also expect to see a significant fall in potency-increasing
                            innovation, as the law enforcement avoidance incentive would no longer
                            exist. However, whether we would see a reduction in potency itself (rather
                            than its rate of increase) is less sure: Addictions may have already
                            formed. However, in the Alcohol Prohibition example, spirit consumption did
                            fall significantly (as a percentage of units consumed) after Prohibition
                            ended to slightly above the previous rates (Thornton, 1991, p. 3).

                            It is also relative assured that, provided taxes and regulatory
                            requirements imposed by government were not excessive, the legal and
                            regulated market would displace illegal and criminal operators. This is
                            because consumers wish to be assured of the quality and safety of their
                            drugs, which they could be in the regulated market.

                        <p>
                            We ought to adopt a legalized and regulated market for all drugs. This
                            market should have strong age limits, prescription-only sale of the hardest
                            drugs, the typical bans of advertising, and compulsory labelling
                            requirements, including of safe dosages and ingredients. We should also
                            divert significant funds from existing enforcement efforts into
                            rehabilitation efforts. This would be a more liberal mix of the Portuguese,
                            American and Swiss approaches, aiming to ensure consumer safety – with the
                            realization that drug use is essentially unavoidable.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To begin, the Misuse of Drugs Act, and other related provisions in other
                            legislation should be repealed and replaced by a new legislative framework,
                            the Drugs Act.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This Act should create a licensing system for drug treatment centres. These
                            centres would be private enterprises staffed by qualified doctors, nurses,
                            psychiatrists and others and they would, in some cases, be subsidized by
                            the Government. Such Accredited Drug Treatment Centres (ADTCs) would be
                            granted special exemptions to the new rules regarding the dealing and
                            growing of different drugs. Those wishing to start an ADTC would be
                            required to meet good character requirements and submit to the Police
                            details of how they intended to purchase and store the drugs. Employees
                            would also be required to submit to background checks and harsh penalties
                            would be imposed on both employees and centres who improperly distributed
                            drugs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In specific terms, however, let’s look at what this liberal approach would
                            look like for various drugs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For cannabis, I would propose full legalization. It would be essentially
                            regulated like spirit alcohol: Dispensaries would be subject to licensing
                            authority approval (and sales would only be permitted in dispensaries, not
                            supermarkets, for instance), sales would be excise-taxed (though not to the
                            excessive levels of tobacco, as discussed on p. 49), television advertising
                            would be banned, smoking in protected environments would be illegal.
                            Cannabis is relatively risk-free – suggesting that a hands-off approach
                            will have very little public health cost. However, use by younger people is
                            the greatest concern. However, the legal approach is the one which manages
                            this risk better: Dealers don’t check ID, but dispensaries would, at risk
                            of losing their license to trade and being fined significantly.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For synthetics, the scourge of modern New Zealand, the answer is more
                            complicated. Like all products sold in New Zealand, if their use resulted
                            in the death or serious harm of a user, the retailer and producer should be
                            held both criminally and civilly liable, if it was a result of their
                            negligence or malfeasance. The mislabelling of drugs too should be heavily
                            punished. However, the particular controls placed on different synthetics
                            should depend on their composition. Not all synthetics are alike. Those
                            containing dangerous opioids, like fentanyl, should be illegal for sale
                            without a prescription – the dangers of overdose are too high. Others could
                            be legal, within the strict guidelines proposed. It is safer if they are
                            subject to open regulation than back within the black market. All should be
                            able to be tested. Police stations and other public facilities, where
                            practicable, should be equipped to test for the most dangerous parts of
                            synthetics, without exposing the tester to legal jeopardy. Immunity should
                            be granted, as a matter of policy and in public, to users who report
                            dealers of dangerous drugs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For the highest profile drug, methamphetamine, and other hard drugs, the
                            approach I propose is simple: Addicts should be helped off the drug, new
                            recruits given no chance to start. Therefore, meth and the other most
                            dangerous drugs should follow the Portuguese model of decriminalization
                            whereby the possession of small amounts of these drugs without a or in
                            excess of a drug treatment prescription would become a health issue rather
                            than criminal offence. Those caught using such drugs without prescription
                            for the first time would be required to submit to a treatment centre for an
                            assessment. If they were found to be addicted, ADTCs could embark on a
                            course of drug-replacement therapy and rehabilitation, while if they
                            weren’t, they could be released with a warning. Records should be taken of
                            people caught in possession of such hard drugs, but they should not be
                            available as part of a criminal record check. Doing so might cause them to
                            become or remain unemployed, feeding desperation, a well-known path into
                            drug reliance. Dealing, producing and otherwise profiting by non-ADTCs from
                            such hard drugs should remain a serious criminal offence. The endangerment
                            of children with them should also remain a serious offence.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In general, drug policy should be determined by the harm profile of the
                            drug.
                            <a name="_Hlk521012598">
                                This should be determined by evidence, not politics. We should
                                establish a Substance Policy Board, headed by an appropriate medical or
                                scientific officer – perhaps, the Prime Minister’s Chief Scientific
                                Advisor – to advise the Government on the medical and scientific
                                evidence on controlled substances, including alcohol and tobacco.
                                Police and Corrections should, of course, be included on such a board,
                                as frontline agencies seeing most of the harm. No return, however,
                                should be made to the inherently flawed policy of prohibition.

                            Overall, this plan should result in lower costs for the New Zealand
                            taxpayer. It would reduce expenditure on incarceration and law enforcement
                            for drug use and would reduce expenditure on the benefit dependence often
                            caused by imprisonment. However, it would increase expenditure on drug and
                            addiction treatment and on the enforcement of licensing requirements, but
                            this should be more than balanced by the reduced expenditure on other areas
                            and the taxes levied on soft drugs – i.e, marijuana and the like.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It should also result in better outcomes for drug users and would allow
                            them to contribute to society in a more meaningful manner. This
                            decriminalization and legalization model means users would avoid
                            imprisonment and a criminal record allowing them to contribute to society
                            in employment. Those addicted would be able to improve their health and
                            lose their dependence through the treatment-based approach. This approach
                            should also allow users of more harmful drugs to continue to provide for
                            their families while undertaking treatment, lessening the load on the
                            Child, Youth and Family system and improving outcomes for their children.

                            While the liberal extremist within me is offended at compulsory treatment
                            and the continued illegality – if not criminalization - of a subset of
                            drugs, it must be so in order to protect society and the vulnerable. I am
                            not quite so brave as Milton Friedman. Society is entitled to intervene in
                            such a case because addicts cannot be considered to be entirely rational,
                            and neither can those about to start an addiction. This, however, should
                            not weaken the case for widespread drug reform. Prohibition, as it did for
                            alcohol, has done immeasurable damage.
