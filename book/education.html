                        <p>
                            It is uncontested in New Zealand today that government has a legitimate
                            role to play in education. There is, sure, significant debate what that
                            legitimate role for government is: Should government set curricula? Fund
                            all levels of education universally? Manage schools or leave it to parents?
                            But not even the most radical politician or academic suggests government
                            leave schooling entirely to the market. However, even if it isn’t a debate
                            being had, determining the reasons <em>why</em> government should be
                            involved in education is crucial in determining <em>how</em> government
                            should be involved.

                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            In his seminal essay on school choice, The Role of Government in Education,
                            Milton Friedman (1955) makes this argument for the state funding of
                            academic education. He argues that the basic education of an individual is
                            valuable not merely to the educated person (because he can use his
                            education to provide higher-value services and therefore, garner higher
                            wages) but to the wider community too. Better educated people, in a
                            democracy, make presumably better democratic decisions – benefitting all,
                            including those who have not invested in an education for themselves. Much
                            of the benefits of general education going to the public rather than the
                            payer suggest it would be under-consumed in the absence of state subsidy –
                            because, when rational consumers make spending decisions, they typically
                            maximise their own utility, not that of the wider community. A state
                            subsidy is needed to re-equilibrate in favour of maximising community
                            welfare.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, this argument can only be carried so far. Friedman draws the line
                            at “general education for citizenship” (p. 2). It is difficult to see any
                            external benefits of purely vocational training <a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"
                                title=""><sup><sup>[2]</sup></sup></a>.
                            The gains accrue entirely through higher earnings to the person trained. <a
                                name="HigherEarningsExternality"></a>The obvious exception to this is
                            how higher earnings from vocational training interact with the tax system
                            and social-welfare system. Presumably, higher earnings from more training
                            reduce expenditure and increase revenue However, assuming the abatement
                            rates/marginal tax rates on these systems are not punitive, consumers
                            should account for this higher income in their own calculations to at least
                            a reasonable degree. Secondly, if we were to count higher tax revenue as a
                            positive externality, we would rationally have to extend this to every
                            other revenue-increasing measure. That is equivalent to subsidising every
                            piece of expenditure which deepened the capital stocks of the country –
                            i.e., subsidising all investment. In other words, it is the same as simply
                            cutting taxes on capital. Overall, therefore, vocational education can be
                            considered to have no real external benefits.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Unfortunately, it is challenging to draw the line between ‘general’ and
                            ‘vocational’ education: Is an economics degree at university general or
                            vocational? Should students at high school who take technology subjects be
                            considered to be undertaking ‘general’ or ‘vocational’ studies? Still, we
                            should draw the line somewhere: Taxpayers should not be required to
                            subsidise that which will have no general benefits and only make the
                            recipient richer.

                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            However, this does not necessarily doom any government support for
                            vocational education. There is a legitimate argument, made by Friedman
                            (1955) and deepened (at least for me) by Harvard economist Caroline Hoxby
                            (2006), that even if government should not directly subsidise education, it
                            should surely intervene in the funding market for it because, as Hoxby puts
                            it, “the capital market for financing education is highly imperfect” (2006,
                            p. 9). This imperfection stems from:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            a) an inability for children – in the compulsory years of education – to
                            sign up to loans or other funding mechanisms to pay for their education
                            (because they are children);
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            b) the unusual nature of human capital investment – it cannot be
                            repossessed if a loan is defaulted on; and,
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            c) the undiversified, and therefore risky, nature of an investment into
                            human capital.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This all means typical profit-seeking funding mechanisms, like bank loans,
                            are ruled out or substantially disadvantaged in education. So, students
                            must seek funding from their parents or other altruistic funding sources.
                            If private loans are available, it might only be to relatively-well-off
                            families who can offer parental guarantors with good credit ratings. This
                            leads to egalitarian and efficiency concerns: For one, most would consider
                            it unfair that able students who would value a vocational education beyond
                            their family’s immediate means be denied it, even if they could easily
                            repay it with post-training earnings. Even leaving aside fairness concerns,
                            denying an education to people who value it more than it costs and who will
                            be able to pay for it post-graduation based on the birth lottery of their
                            parent’s wealth is clearly inefficient: Profitable transactions are not
                            being conducted.

                        <p>
                            The egalitarian argument, that state-funded education is needed to ensure
                            inter-generational wealth mobility, is essentially the flawed capital
                            market argument stated in social, rather than economic terms. Without state
                            intervention to ensure adequate funding, good jobs – even political
                            leadership – will be confined to those who have enough altruistic resources
                            (i.e., wealthy-enough parents) to pay for a good education. This would
                            create a caste-like system, where one’s future was not determined
                            meritocratically but based on the wealth of one’s parents, which would then
                            determine how wealthy one was to provide for one’s children and so-on, in a
                            self-perpetuating cycle of inter-generational inequality. This is the most
                            prevalent, most obvious, and probably most persuasive argument for the
                            state funding of education.

                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            This is the argument with which I have the most trouble. It suggests that a
                            homogenous education, rather than an education in and of itself, is
                            necessary. The argument goes that: In a pluralistic country, children are
                            bought up in a variety of cultures, religions, and socioeconomic
                            circumstances, for instance, and that to create a functioning society
                            thereafter, these differences must be mitigated by a shared experience at
                            school. Most communitarians also hold that were parents to choose their
                            children’s school, segregation would continue into school. By this,
                            communitarian arguments, typically implicitly, also hold that, by virtue of
                            their often-better education, rich parents would make better decisions in a
                            world of choice than poor parents.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Liberal (and socialist) believers in communitarianism argue that private
                            schools and elite public schools insulate their students from real struggle
                            and, by excluding poor students, perpetuate class division by creating
                            shibboleths to which only the wealthy are privy and which they use to
                            ensure continued class dominance. The much-derided ‘old boys’ networks’ are
                            the archetypal example. This, in my view, is a reasonable argument. The
                            problem comes when the solution proposed is not to widen access to the good
                            schools but to destroy them for all, or, even worse, when the prescription
                            is not that this a natural result of the monopolism of school zoning but of
                            ‘parental choice’. This assumes that poorer parents would not send their
                            children to good schools if they were able. It also results in the trapping
                            of more students in bad schools if they cannot escape their zone. The
                            answer is to expand choice, not homogenise: Some receiving better education
                            than others does not justify cutting everyone down to the lowest common
                            denominator, but rather raising everyone up.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On principle, I cannot see why it is the government’s job to homogenise
                            society. That assumes, firstly, that the government knows what the correct
                            way is to homogenise. Sure, on some issues – that everyone should learn to
                            add and subtract and converse in and write English, for instance – there is
                            almost universal agreement. There, enforced homogeneity is acceptable. But
                            on others, it is unclear why the opinions of Wellington bureaucrats or the
                            ruling government should be forced upon everyone. That seems to breed
                            authoritarianism. Where taxpayer funding is at stake, blatantly repugnant
                            views or inaccurate teaching, rejected by the vast majority of society, can
                            be rejected. But contestable matters, like whether students should be
                            assessed by examination or by internal assessment, what areas of history
                            ought to be taught, or whether Bible readings ought to be held, should
                            remain in the hands of parents, to avoid the tyranny of centralisation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The simple practical argument, though slightly difficult to accept, is that
                            if one group of parents make a mistake, that affects their children, but
                            when a bureaucrat makes a mistake, it affects all the children. Homogeneity
                            means a single point of failure, heterogeneity means a surer chance of at
                            least some succeeding in the face of a terrible error.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In response, one could argue that central administrators are infallible or,
                            even, simply far less fallible than parents. That is rather difficult to
                            do, particularly in education. For instance, in Charlotte-Mecklenburg in
                            the United States, girls who were able (as in, chosen by ballot) to attend
                            their first-choice school were 14 percentage points more likely to complete
                            four-year college degrees than identical students who lost the ballot. Boys
                            showed no change (Deming, et al., 2014). Parental choice works better (or
                            no worse, for boys in this study) than government assignment. This ignores,
                            too, the creation of competition between schools by parental choice.

                            Consider, by contrast, the inherently political, rather than scientific,
                            nature of much of modern educational ‘scholarship’ – the basis, surely, of
                            any administrative decision to assign schools. The Reading Wars, between
                            phonics and whole-word approaches to literacy teaching, is an interesting
                            example. Proponents of phonics teaching are “sometimes represented as
                            closet Christian fundamentalists who use phonetics instrumentally to
                            bolster traditional authority” (Furedi, 2015). Their opponents include the
                            Whole Language Movement which openly describes itself as “political
                            movement”, fighting against “a right-wing or neo-liberal agenda”. But
                            whole-word proponents have not got off easy either: They are accused by
                            phonics proponents of “destroying the innocent” with their methods. In New
                            Zealand, we see many cases of political, rather than scientific, judgement
                            determining the future of our children: On mathematics education, the
                            Numeracy Project is heavily contested, despite having been adopted
                            wholesale by the Ministry. The standards-based vs norm-referencing debate
                            in assessing students is far from settled, and yet, one was adopted
                            across-the-board nationally with the introduction of the NCEA.
                            Educationalists and educational officials are just as, perhaps more, prone
                            to non-scientific and uninformed decision-making as parents. It is,
                            therefore, difficult to grant any credence to a contention that officials
                            are so impervious to error and parents so susceptible thereto that
                            introducing a single point of failure is a good idea. Surely the less risky
                            approach is decentralisation.

                            The first three arguments – of external benefits of education, of a flawed
                            capital market existing, and of egalitarian concerns necessitating
                            equality-of-access – are extremely compelling. Government intervention is
                            clearly necessary in the education market. But, it is unclear that this
                            intervention must take the shape of New Zealand’s current system. The flaws
                            in the communitarian argument serve as a good argument against increasing
                            state control of the education system. Increased choice seems, essentially,
                            a no-brainer.

                            internationally accomplished statesmen and the Prime Minister during the
                            Second World War (and in my view, one of our greatest), had for the public
                            education system in 1939. It has been the goal of compulsory education in
                            this country ever since. Sadly, the current situation is a long way off.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Right now, the compulsory education system performs very well –compared to
                            other Western nations - for those at or near the top of the socio-economic
                            ladder. However, those nearer the bottom are shafted. This is a global
                            phenomenon, but its particularly bad here.

                            In New Zealand, more than 13% of the average student's performance on the
                            mathematics section of the international PISA assessment (undertaken by a
                            sample of 15-year-old students) is purely determined by his socio-economic
                            class, far from the egalitarian and meritocratic paradise envisioned in
                            1939. This is much worse than many of international peers – only Ireland
                            and Singapore in the Anglosphere have less equality, which they compensate
                            for with far higher achievement rates.

                            Figure 1 – Data: OECD (2016). The green quadrant shows the ideal situation
                            – high performance with high equity. The orange quadrant shows suboptimal
                            positions and the red is the least preferred option – below average
                            performance, combined with below average equity.

                        <p>
                            Later in school, this inequality is magnified. In New Zealand Scholarship,
                            the most prestigious secondary examination offered by NZQA, Decile 10
                            students entered the examinations at over 15 times the rate of Decile 1
                            students (Lipson, 2018).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is a problem. It is obviously unfair for the individual who, purely
                            because of his parents' income, can't achieve to his potential. But more
                            than that, on a larger scale, it may well result in lower productivity and
                            therefore, a worse lifestyle for all of us, in aggregate, than we otherwise
                            could enjoy. This country has a limited amount spaces at quality schools
                            available. We may not like that, but it is a fact: some schools are better
                            than others and, in the current system, those schools are stuck at their
                            current size. Right now, through both private schools and zoning for
                            in-demand state schools, we allocate those spaces on the basis of parental
                            wealth (in that wealthier parents can afford private fees or to move into
                            the zones of quality schools, which generally add a premium to property
                            prices and rents).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This deductive analysis of the costs of education inequality is backed and
                            indeed extended by the empirical evidence. Sabatés, Feinstein, and Shingal
                            (2008), for instance, found a significant correlation, controlling for
                            other relevant variables, between increasing educational inequality and
                            juvenile crime rates.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Of course, that model of educational inequality raises many crucial
                            questions: why are some schools better than others? Why are the best
                            schools concentrated in areas of high wealth? And the most important of
                            them all, why don't poorer schools simply copy the best schools?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I won't focus on the first question of why some schools are better than
                            others because it is probably best left to the educationalists (and, in my
                            view, the market). The second and third questions, however, are ripe for
                            economic analysis.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Before I begin this analysis though, I should outline a basic – but
                            apparently controversial - assumption I make of school administrators: that
                            they seek to maximise their budget/revenue. This assumption comes from
                            Niskanen (1968)’s famous paper on the ‘peculiar economics of bureaucracy’.
                            Revenue can be considered the quantity maximised by administrators because
                            it seems the only quantity which varies uniformly in concert with what are
                            presumed to be important for self-interested bureaucrats: the prestige of
                            their position, ease of management <a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a>, power,
                            even salary. I
                            also assume that school administrators wish to advance in their careers.
                            This should be relatively uncontentious.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The reason the best schools, whether public or private, are concentrated in
                            wealthier areas is simple: competition. The wealthiest parents have a much
                            wider variety of options when choosing where to send their son or daughter
                            to school than poorer families. They have the entirety of the private
                            sector open to their consideration, as well as every public school in the
                            country - because they can afford the premium to move into their zones.
                            This naturally encourages schools, which, whether private or public, depend
                            on per-capita fees, in their area to improve to attract their 'business',
                            as it were, because otherwise they might lose that business.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As to why schools in poorer areas don't improve by copying the wealthier
                            schools, the answer is slightly more complex.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Firstly, it is because, unlike schools in wealthier areas, these schools
                            are not exposed to the competitive forces detailed above. Essentially,
                            parents of a lower socio-economic class have far less choice available to
                            them: they can't afford private school fees or to move into a good school
                            zone and pay the resultant rent premium. They are therefore a captive
                            audience for their local school. In effect, their local school has an
                            effective monopoly over the education of their children. As all economic
                            experience shows, monopolies have no incentive to innovate (because they
                            can't lose their business), and therefore, generally, provide a worse
                            service at a higher price.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The other reason lies in the monopoly that teachers' unions and the
                            Ministry of Education have over teachers. Public schools have no choice in
                            the pay rates of teachers they employ; all are employed under a collective
                            agreement negotiated between the unions and the Ministry. This contract,
                            unlike those in most other professions, is not designed to reward success
                            and excellence, but rather seniority. Private schools can bypass this
                            poorly-designed collective agreement and set up their own pay structure,
                            while public schools with well-off parents and alumni can supplement the
                            collective agreements with external incentives, like privately-financed
                            bonuses and sabbaticals (e.g., those from Auckland Grammar's
                            multi-million-dollar Academic Endowment Fund). Schools in poorer areas have
                            no such opportunities available.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So how do we fix this? Given my diagnosis of why the problem of educational
                            inequality occurs: government-enforced monopolism in the education market
                            for less privileged students, the answer seems obvious: get rid of each of
                            the anti-competitive forces that restrain the market.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In order to establish adequate competition in any market, both sides of the
                            transaction should have sufficient information about the other party,
                            particularly the buyer about the quality of the seller's goods. Creating
                            this transparency is particularly difficult in New Zealand education, given
                            the NCEA system. I shall discuss my preferred reforms to those later. As
                            such, we should create a centralized website for parents and students to
                            compare schools which includes data on standardized exam results, rates of
                            improvement, Education Review Office reports and short, readable summaries
                            of these reports and the qualifications of the teaching staff.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Once the prerequisites for a competitive market are established, we should
                            abolish central control of admissions into public schools - i.e., the
                            zoning system. This system unfairly restricts admissions into good,
                            so-called public schools to those wealthy enough to pay the in-zone rent or
                            land price premium. Worse, unlike private school fees, the premia for high
                            quality schools do not go to the schools – thereby, encouraging more
                            schools to be good and thus, increase their budget – but rather to
                            incumbent landholders. This is blatantly unfair – what have landowners done
                            to earn these gains? - and inefficient. Instead, we should allow schools to
                            determine their own admissions system, whether that be based on an
                            interview, exam or any other merit-based approach or a fair lottery, thus
                            levelling the playing field for students of all socioeconomic classes. It
                            is crucial to note here that the incentive on schools will always be to
                            admit as many students as possible – because they are paid per attending
                            student.

                        <p>
                            It is also crucial that we abolish Wellington-negotiated collective
                            agreements for state school teachers. Teachers, like all other
                            professionals, should become employed directly by schools and engage with
                            their employers to negotiate an individual or voluntary collective
                            contract. Teachers and schools would become bound by existing labour
                            relations laws which govern union access and collective agreements. This
                            would allow schools to pay good teachers more and take action if a teacher
                            is providing an unsatisfactory service (i.e., fire bad teachers), thus
                            incentivising teachers to perform at their best. It would also somewhat
                            level the playing field between private schools and their well-capitalized
                            state school cousins and other state schools.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Compulsory qualification requirements for teachers should also be
                            abolished. Teacher quality is undeniably a crucial, if not the foremost,
                            factor in determining educational success. Counterintuitively, however,
                            compulsory qualification requirements are not useful in achieving higher
                            quality levels. For one, this policy has locked out significant numbers of
                            well-qualified foreign applicants from our schools, worsening the teacher
                            shortage. Secondly, evidence from the United States finds little
                            association between qualification levels <em><u>in education</u></em> and
                            results. For instance, Gordon, et al. (2006)’s study of the Los Angeles
                            public schools found no statistically significant difference between the
                            effectiveness of certified, alternatively-certified and uncertified
                            teachers, based on mathematics test results. Another study by Buddin and
                            Zamarro (2009) found no relationship between licensure test results and
                            student performance. They also found no effect of teachers having advanced
                            degrees on results. However, there is evidence elsewhere (for instance,
                            Zhang (2008) on science teachers) that higher-level qualifications not in
                            teaching, but rather in subject areas is useful. But given the evidence is
                            unclear and the possible cost (of excluding qualified foreign teachers) is
                            high, this should be left for schools and parents to decide: It could, for
                            instance, be better for some schools to have more, less qualified teachers
                            to cut class sizes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Next, we should radically reform the school funding system. Right now, the
                            system entails a complex web of direct government grants to state and
                            state-integrated schools for capital expenditure, teacher salaries, and a
                            myriad of other items as well as the private school subsidy. This system
                            allows public schools little effective choice in the allocation of their
                            revenues, meaning they can't prioritise what is most useful to their
                            students.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Instead of this convoluted system, every New Zealand student should be
                            given an annual educational grant and have an Individual Education Account
                            set up for him. The grant should be based on his age, location, and any
                            special educational needs he may have and his parents' income (decreasing
                            as this income increases). Every school (public or private) that wished to
                            be eligible to receive IEA funds, would charge a fee, set by the school
                            itself. However, for students unable to pay any extra fees or the entire
                            amount (as determined by a calculation by the Ministry <a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"
                                title="">[5]</a>), schools would be
                            required to make-up he difference. Needs-aware admission would be illegal.
                            High-fee schools would essentially be required to cross-subsidise poorer
                            students. Remaining funds in Individual Education Accounts could be used to
                            pay for authorized educational expenditures, such as transport,
                            extracurricular fees, tutoring, uniforms and/or stationery.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Parents should be required – at all income levels, including the lowest –
                            to contribute to their children’s fund. An increase to cash payments to
                            poorer families should be made to make this have no impact on their net
                            cash position after this contribution. They will simply personally pay the
                            cash. Higher-earning parents should be required to top up the lower
                            educational grant their children receive to an amount approaching the full
                            level. By relying on the natural human propensity to fall victim to the
                            sunk-cost fallacy, this requirement gives parents a stake in ensuring their
                            children turn up to school and perform to their best – it is their money at
                            stake. It would also ensure the incentive remained on private schools to
                            accept IEA funds and therefore, to allow access by poorer students.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Such a funding system would open the private education system to a vast
                            swathe of New Zealand society - thereby adding further competition to the
                            system and encouraging schools to do their best for all students, not just
                            those currently with the means to leave. It would also give public schools
                            the same ability to determine their expenditure based on what is most
                            useful to their students that private schools already have and allow
                            parents to provide opportunities to their children previously out of reach,
                            like sports and extra tutoring if they require it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The crucial element, however, is supply flexibility. This has been the
                            underlying flaw of most attempts at school choice. Without the ability of
                            good schools to expand, and bad schools to close, all any school choice
                            project does is redistribute good education (and possibly introduce some
                            competition, creating some general improvements). If the ability opens up,
                            given administrators are interested in budget-maximising, schools with
                            excess demand are sure to expand. This requires two major changes:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            First is the reform of the legal structure of state schools. As Crown
                            Entities governed by the Education Act, it is currently near impossible for
                            schools to change their operating structure significantly. Instead,
                            ‘public’ schools should be reformed as self-governing trusts. Their
                            original constitutions should remain at the beginning, but Boards should be
                            free to cooperate with other schools – for instance, in creating a shared
                            governance structure, like a franchising chain, to overcome regional
                            weaknesses in Board strength and to share administrative expenses and
                            curricula – and other organisations, like employers, tertiary institutions,
                            and religious groups. They should be permitted to start new schools too.
                            They should also be permitted to fail. It should be made clear that no
                            under-performing school would be bailed out by the taxpayer. Why should
                            taxpayers be required to put up funds to prop up an unviable school -
                            either through poor financial management or a lack of students? This would
                            create real market accountability and allow failed experiments to fail.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Second are changes to the management of school property. In the status quo,
                            school property is essentially entirely managed by the Ministry of
                            Education who ‘lease’ it to school Boards of Trustees, for free. Such a
                            system continuing would provide incumbent schools with too much of a
                            competitive advantage, particularly given the price of Auckland land: Money
                            saved on land could be reassigned to educational expenses, whereas
                            challengers would have to spend significant amounts of their funding on it.
                            Instead, the school property portfolio should be leased to schools, on
                            market terms. Tenders should be held, open to all registered schools or
                            proprietors who can prove to the Ministry that they would be able to staff
                            and fill a school on the property. There would exist no incentive to
                            challenge good schools – one would not be able to justify paying a higher
                            lease if no latent demand existed. However, bad schools – which parents
                            were hastening to leave – would be unable to sustain their existing leases
                            and could be replaced by better alternatives. Funds earnt from the lease
                            process should be part of the education budget used to pay for the annual
                            education grants.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There should remain some discretion for education officials to bar schools
                            with repugnant or clearly failing practices from receiving IEA funding.
                            However, the competitive pressures of fully mobile funds and competitive
                            land tenders should force bad schools to close naturally. If this does not
                            occur, this suggests that parents must be seriously ill-informed or the
                            barriers to entry for competitors in the area must be very high. That
                            should be the bar officials must meet before barring a school from funding.
                            It should not be enough that an official merely thinks it is uneconomic for
                            a school to be operating in an area, for instance – as was decided during
                            the Christchurch Earthquake for many schools. If the school is uneconomic,
                            it will close of its own accord.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is true that this scheme could result in some students being required to
                            move schools. Certainly, this would be the case in the early years of any
                            such system. The system would have to re-equilibrate to meet parental
                            demands for schools. Instability, in and of itself, is not helpful for the
                            education of children, however, when this instability results in them
                            moving to better schools and better schools being established for future
                            cohorts of students, it is a necessary evil.

                            The progressive education movement has been exceptionally adept at
                            capturing the New Zealand education system. Progressivists claim to adopt
                            Toffler’s perspective. Knowledge, they contest, is essentially useless in
                            the Internet age – it can all be Googled. Subjects are useless ‘social
                            constructs’, mere barriers in the creation of holistic learning. Far more
                            important is the development of ‘21<sup>st</sup> century skills’. To
                            develop these, students should be permitted to construct their learning
                            themselves. Direct instruction – the style of teaching most will be
                            familiar with, where a teacher instructs the students as a class – is
                            outmoded. Indeed, its explicit power dynamic, where students are subjects
                            of the teacher, is “fascist” (Delpit, 1988).

                            Given my slightly incredulous tone, you may have sensed I am not a great
                            fan of progressive education. Students must be taught deep subject-specific
                            knowledge. Without this, it is impossible to develop the nuanced
                            understanding of the world which surely underlies any ‘21<sup>st</sup>
                            century skills’ students require. Direct instruction is an evidence-based
                            pedagogical technique not an ideological reinforcement of prevailing
                            capitalist power structures. John Hattie (2012), in his masterful
                            meta-study of research into educational interventions, found a year spent
                            with direct instruction would produce gains equivalent to almost 1.5 years
                            of typical teaching. That would be equivalent to an extra 2 years of high
                            school education. And yes, high-stakes external examinations of the entire
                            syllabus in which the content is surprising are necessary too. <a href="#_ftn6"

                            My point, however, is not to rehash the conservative-vs-progressive
                            education debate. Though I am convinced of my views, I am not arrogant
                            enough to suggest they are formed well enough to force upon every child in
                            the country. Successive New Zealand governments, however, have been.

                            The Government subsidy for the National Certificate of Education
                            Achievement (NCEA) functions to effectively constrain budget-limited public
                            schools to the NCEA system. Alternative exam systems lack the $28 million
                            of the education budget (The Treasury, 2018) given in subsidy to NCEA.
                            Schools which serve non-affluent communities cannot do as high-decile and
                            private schools do and simply charge parents for the full cost of competing
                            examination systems. Simply look at the list of schools which offer the
                            International Baccalaureate Diploma (IB), an NCEA alternative, in New
                            Zealand. They have an average decile of 9.75 – only two IB schools do not
                            serve the top 10% of students by the socioeconomic status of their
                            neighbourhood. A similar trend is evident in the schools which offer the
                            University of Cambridge International Examinations (CIE), another NCEA
                            alternative. Alternatives are simply not available to poorer students.

                        <p>
                            NCEA’s competitive advantage is amplified by it being the Ministry, rather
                            than schools, who manage teacher payroll. NCEA’s internal assessment
                            approach entails significantly higher teacher workload. Schools do not feel
                            this extra cost and therefore, will account for it less when choosing the
                            examination system they offer.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The significant subsidy – both implicit and explicit – of NCEA, therefore,
                            amounts to what is essentially a Ministry diktat governing the examination
                            systems offered at non-elite schools. What examination system a school
                            offers has a significant effect on how it teaches. The highly-modularised,
                            ultra-flexible model offered by NCEA inherently de-emphasises the
                            importance of subject-wide knowledge. It also significantly constrains the
                            scope of exams. Teachers, therefore, do not need to teach the entire
                            subject so students can meet any content within the syllabus in the exam.
                            Instead, the content is relatively known before the examination, increasing
                            the utility of ‘teaching to the test’. NCEA is the quintessential
                            progressive qualification. By contrast, alternative systems like CIE and IB
                            mark students compared to their peers, rather than ‘standards’. They
                            provide unfamiliar questions in high-stakes examinations. In English
                            Literature, they make reading the Western canon compulsory. Both require
                            deep and broad knowledge by students across set syllabi so they may perform
                            well, essentially requiring direct instruction. They are inherently
                            conservative. Indeed, one progressive New Zealand former headmistress
                            described exams themselves as “a colonial system” (Milne, 2018) – those set
                            and marked in the United Kingdom are surely even more so.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Whichever is better, international or NCEA, examination systems are clearly
                            not a pedagogy-agnostic measure of achievement. They have clear and
                            significant impacts on how students are taught. There is the significant
                            diversity in opinion on how students ought to be taught among teachers and
                            parents. Given their power and the lack of unanimity about the right course
                            of action, there is inherent danger in any government policy which
                            significantly favours one examination system over another. This is
                            particularly bad when such power is only effective over poorer students.

                            Instead, Government should reallocate that $28 million of funding for NCEA
                            to the general fund for secondary education. It should be distributed to
                            schools for them to spend in the best way they see fit, whether that is on
                            NCEA, CIE, IB or any other qualification – perhaps, Auckland Grammar’s new
                            in-house Pre-Q examination system for Year 11, an Australian state’s
                            qualification, or the American Advanced Placement examinations. There
                            exists significant competition in the assessment market. As is the case
                            today, universities – both foreign and domestic – would probably be the
                            principal arbiters of quality. The accountability of university and
                            employer requirements would ensure schools did not engage in rampant grade
                            inflation.

                        <p>
                            NZQA should also be restructured. The regulator of qualifications should
                            not concurrently be a provider thereof. An organisation with so obvious a
                            conflict of interest simply cannot be expected to organise a credible exam
                            system. Instead, a model like that of England should be adopted. There,
                            exams are administered and syllabi set by private examination boards. A
                            separate ‘exam watchdog’, called Ofqual (the Office of Qualifications and
                            Examinations Regulation), manages the quality and comparability of
                            qualifications at the same level. I would propose, in New Zealand, the
                            administration and syllabus design for NCEA be spun off into an independent
                            trust, comprised of Government, university, school, and employer
                            representatives. In addition to rectifying the conflict of interest, this
                            would helpfully insulate NCEA from political desires to manipulate pass
                            rates to reflect better on the Government. A merger could then be
                            considered between the remainder of NZQA and the Educational Review Office
                            – both would have the fundamental functions of insuring the credibility and
                            quality of the New Zealand education system and providing good information
                            to regulators, parents, and employers. Such an independent Education
                            Standards Commission would be a much more credible guarantor of exam
                            standards and bulwark against grade inflation than the existing conflicted
                            NZQA.

                            the average tertiary student paid less than 18% of the cost of his degree
                            (Productivity Commission, 2017). Taxpayers fund the remainder. That funding
                            includes both written-off interest and direct government subsidies to
                            universities and other tertiary education facilities. Such a significant
                            level of subsidy seems excessive.

                            Tertiary graduates will typically earn significant wage premia as a result
                            of their education. In New Zealand, the average university graduate earns a
                            premium of 170% over the average weekly wage of those with no
                            qualifications. Similarly, those with Diplomas or Certificates earn an
                            average income premium of 116% over those with no qualifications (Ministry
                            of Education, 2018). Of course, there is some selection bias in those
                            figures – those who attend university would, on average, probably earn more
                            than the average even if they had not. Still, however, it is clear there
                            are significant private returns to tertiary education. This suggests that,
                            even in the absence of significant subsidy, many would still undertake it
                            and that, if they were required to pay more of the full economic cost of
                            their degree, many graduates would be able to do so (presuming they had
                            access to finance). It also suggests that subsidies for higher education
                            are regressive. In absolute terms and, presumably, as a percentage of
                            income, the well-off would – on average – have received far more government
                            support for tertiary education than the poorest.

                            Of course, there are possibly some positive externalities of tertiary
                            education. The rest of us might gain from university graduates gaining an
                            education. The first and obvious channel is through lightened fiscal
                            pressure. Graduates earn more and are far less likely to be unemployed.
                            They will, therefore, contribute more in tax – lessening the load on the
                            rest of us – and use fewer social welfare resources. However, as laid out
                            in the <em>Externality Argument</em> section above <a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"
                                title="">[7]</a>, such externalities are
                            irrelevant to policy analysis – subsidising them is equivalent to simply
                            cutting all taxes on capital (that is, however, advisable). Another
                            plausible channel for external benefits is through the improvement to
                            democracy. Friedman made a similar argument, discussed above, for
                            elementary schooling. Graduates could improve democratic decisions,
                            benefiting the rest of us, by making more informed votes or being good
                            politicians. Such an externality is likely to be insignificant per graduate
                            however – given he would account for only 1 in 3.3mn voters. It is also
                            unclear, given that degrees in New Zealand are not typically liberal arts
                            in nature, that every tertiary course is useful at all in this respect.
                            There could also be an externality whereby increasing the productivity
                            and/or knowledge of gradates also increases the productivity – and
                            therefore, wages – of other workers. The best work on this, however, from
                            Acemoglu and Angrist (2000) finds no statistically significant external
                            benefits of human capital investment. Overall, it is difficult to find any
                            good justification for 82% of tertiary education being funded by the
                            public. Most of the gains seem to go to graduates. Why then should their
                            education be funded by taxpayers?

                        <p>
                            The fundamental argument against state subsidies for higher education is
                            one of both efficiency and equity. Why is an investment in human capital so
                            much more desirable than an investment in physical capital? One suspects
                            the answer lies in the intellectual snobbery of ministers and their
                            advisors, almost all of whom attended university. The Fourth National
                            Government’s Ministerial Consultative Group on tertiary education raised
                            the pertinent counterpoint: “Similar grants are not made available to
                            people who wish to establish a business. For example, a young person buying
                            a herd to become a sharemilker could not expect the taxpayers to meet 80%
                            of the costs.”

                            If human capital investment is to be subsidised, surely physical capital
                            investment should be too.

                            That we significantly subsidise one type of capital accumulation but not
                            another seems a recipe for inefficiency – some young people who would
                            better spend their time accumulating physical capital (like cows, for
                            instance) are diverted by the subsidy into a suboptimal use of one of their
                            most valuable resources – time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The flawed capital markets argument discussed on page 12 is the strongest
                            argument for government involvement in funding tertiary education. In a
                            fully-efficient capital market, would-be students who could not fund their
                            education upfront could simply go to a bank (or similar lender) and request
                            a loan to pay for their student loan. Banks would be willing to give this
                            money to those who would be able to pay back that loan in the future.
                            Unfortunately, for the reasons laid out above, such a market does not and
                            cannot exist. Government, therefore, has a reasonable part to play in
                            providing repayable loans to pay for tertiary education. This argument,
                            however, only extends to the provision of loans at terms the market would
                            provide them if it could; it does not extend to the subsidisation of those
                            loans.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Using such a justification would require student loans be offered at
                            significantly higher interest rates. No reasonable market lender would
                            offer 0% student loans. The interest rate on any given loan can be
                            understood as a function of both the risk-free rate of return a lender
                            could earn if he were to reallocate his funds elsewhere <a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9"
                                title="">[9]</a> and the risk of default
                            by the borrower. The risk-free rate of return is typically said to be the
                            return on high-quality government securities. Therefore, even if we assumed
                            (ludicrously) that lending to an individual student was as safe as lending
                            to the New Zealand Government, the market would require interest rates of
                            around 3% on student loans. If interest rates are set below the
                            Government’s cost of borrowing, every dollar lent out in the Student Loan
                            Scheme would (and does) create a loss, even if every loan was repaid, in
                            full and on time, because the Government must borrow the money from global
                            credit markets at a higher interest rate than it lends it out.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Before the Fifth Labour Government removed all interest on student loans,
                            the interest rate was set in a relatively rational manner. It equalled the
                            Government’s cost of borrowing plus one percentage point. Treasury had
                            estimated that the default rate on student loans would be approximately 2%.
                            The addition of only 1% to the cost of borrowing meant that taxpayers
                            assumed about half the default risk themselves. If one strictly follows the
                            ‘flawed capital markets’ argument with no allowance for externality, such
                            an assumption of risk by taxpayers is unjustified. I do, however, think
                            there are some (relatively minor) externalities to tertiary education (such
                            as the impact on democracy), justifying this small interest subsidy.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is unclear to me why tertiary education needs subsidy greater than this.
                            If one wishes to encourage job growth and productivity through capital
                            accumulation, simply cut all taxes on capital to do it in an even-handed
                            and efficient way. If one wishes to subsidise basic research – a useful
                            role for government, do so. Use mechanisms like the American National
                            Science Foundation’s contestable grants; attaching research funding to
                            education is an unnecessary overcomplication and certainly less efficient.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We should return capital investment to the control of individuals and level
                            the playing field. Tertiary education subsidies should be cut to zero,
                            including those for apprenticeships, trades programmes, and the first year
                            of university. All future student loans should be charged interest,
                            calculated in the pre-2000 manner, accumulating from the beginning of
                            tertiary education. Repayment should remain income-contingent and part of
                            the PAYE tax system for New Zealand residents. We should also significantly
                            increase borrowing limits for living expenses.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This shift to an almost entirely user-pays model of higher education would
                            mean true market forces would re-emerge in the higher education market.
                            When, as is the case today, students can easily access ultra-cheap money,
                            the incentive for students and universities keep costs low is dampened.
                            Inevitably, Government has had to impose price controls on course fees to
                            avoid an explosion in costs. When it is students who will bear (eventually)
                            the vast majority of the cost of their education, such price controls will
                            no longer be necessary. They will create downward price pressure
                            themselves. In the absence of price controls, higher education providers
                            are more likely to innovate and produce higher value products which they
                            can charge more for. This could be a route to the creation of the first
                            truly world-class New Zealand university.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Such a scheme would not reduce the access to tertiary education by
                            disadvantaged students. There are two principal barriers to tertiary
                            education for poor students, both of which are bettered by this approach:
                            Poor secondary education and living costs. Less than 30% of Year 13
                            students at Decile 1-3 schools achieve University Entrance (the bare
                            minimum required to attend university), compared to almost two-thirds of
                            students in Decile 8-10 schools. (NZQA, 2018). A fully user-pays model of
                            tertiary education would encourage universities to accept as many students
                            as possible and could allow students who had been poorly served at high
                            school to pay extra (on loan) for intensive study to bring them up to
                            speed. In the second case, because taxpayers will no longer be
                            significantly subsidising student loans, the binding constraint which has
                            held down living costs support is removed. Now, allowing students to draw
                            on their student loans for living costs will be much less costly for
                            taxpayers and such support can be expanded significantly.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In addition, a user-pays tertiary model will save a significant amount of
                            taxpayer money which can be reallocated to removing the actual constraints
                            which reduce tertiary attendance by poorer students. In FY2018, the
                            Government reported student loan interest write-offs alone accounted for
                            $594 million in subsidy to tertiary students this year. If that funding was
                            reallocated to senior secondary students in Decile 1-3 schools, it would
                            represent a funding boost of almost $22,000 per pupil – or 2.5 times the
                            current average spending per pupil in the senior years of high school. A
                            dramatic increase in funding for poor secondary schools would achieve far
                            more for access to tertiary education than continuing to provide
                            interest-free loans to all students, no matter their ability to provide for
                            themselves or the utility of their course.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is also unclear to me why universities and polytechnics should be in
                            state ownership. That they are seems simply an artefact of times past, when
                            we had a far more centralized, elite university system, which closer
                            resembled a system of training colleges for the professions, the civil
                            service, and academia than the diverse range of universities and
                            polytechnics we have today. Already, each campus has significant autonomy
                            from the Crown. Ministerial diktats are all but expressly forbidden by the
                            Education Act. Still, however, their status as public organizations creates
                            some strictures – for instance, discouraging private donations, because
                            would-be donors feel this is the role of the government - which could be
                            avoided where they to be restructured into a legal form which reflected
                            their independence. I would suggest charitable trusts.

                            The fundamental error of New Zealand’s educational system for many years
                            has been a lack of trust in individuals and families. It should be
                            recognised that, though they are clearly not perfect – far from it,
                            families are better aware of their own circumstances than any
                            Wellington-based bureaucrat (or regional hub staffer) could possibly be.
                            Decentralising decision-making too reduces the risk of poor decisions
                            having disastrous systematic impacts. Additionally, it ensures the
                            continued diversity of our country and generates much needed competition.

                            Education, just because we view it as a ‘human right’, does not become
                            exempt from the normal rules of economics. The sooner we abandon hopeless
                            romanticism about the inherent value of state-provided education, the
                            better. Ends, not means, should be the focus of education policy.

                                    What follows is a selective survey of the most important arguments
                                    for government involvement in education. The names I have given the
                                    arguments aren’t necessarily the most widely-known ones, but merely
                                    ones I have chosen for convenience.
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <div id="ftn2">
                                <p>
                                    <a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a>
                                    The only exception to this is how higher earnings from vocational
                                    training interact with the tax system and social-welfare system.
                                    Presumably, higher earnings from more training reduce expenditure
                                    and increase revenue. However:
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    1) Assuming the abatement rates/marginal tax rates on these systems
                                    are not punitive, consumers should account for this higher income
                                    in their own calculations to at least a reasonable degree;
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    2) If we were to count higher tax revenue as a positive
                                    externality, we would – were we to rationally extend this to every
                                    other revenue-increasing measure – have to subsidise literally
                                    every capital-deepening expenditure. This is equivalent to simply
                                    cutting taxes
                                </p>

                            <div id="ftn3">
                                <p>

                                    Quoted in accordance with the Ministry of Culture and Heritage
                                    (2017). Clarence Beeby, a New Zealand education reformer, could
                                    possibly be said also to be the author of this excellent quote but
                                    this is immaterial: Fraser certainly agreed with its sentiments.
                                </p>

                                    This one is complicated. While an increase in budget certainly
                                    eases management – it reduces cost pressure and the need to make
                                    tough decisions like restructuring – a large budget in absolute
                                    terms is presumably more difficult to manage than a small one.
                                </p>

                                    Such a calculation should take a similar form to that used by
                                    universities in the United States who commit to meeting the ‘full
                                    demonstrable need’ of their students with financial aid. In
                                    particular, it should consider the fees (and other costs of
                                    attendance, including transport) as a percentage of paternal
                                    income, while considering the number of other dependents in the
                                    family.

                                    I owe this argument about the necessity of surprise in assessment
                                    to Briar Lipson (2018)’s excellent critique of the NCEA system.

                                    My thanks to Khyaati Acharya and Dr Eric Crampton for drawing my
                                    attention to this report and, in particular, this wonderful
                                    quotation in their excellent report for the New Zealand Initiative,
                                    Decade of Debt: The Cost of Interest-Free Student Loans, (Acharya
                                    &amp; Crampton, 2016).

                                    This, of course, is why consumer and business lending rates are
                                    sensitive to the Official Cash Rate set by the Reserve Bank. The
                                    OCR (minus 25 basis points) is a risk-free rate available to
                                    registered banks on overnight deposits at the Reserve Bank.
